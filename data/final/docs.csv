lucknow: the all-india babri masjid action committee (aibmac) has sought a ban on vhp-sponsored march 15 programme at the acquired land in ayodhya. holding a state-level meeting on saturday, aibmac convenor jafrayab jilani said that the proposed â€˜bhoomi pujanâ€™, even if it was symbolic, would be in violation of the supreme court status quo order. â€œwe demand a ban on the vhp programme as it is in clear violation of the supreme court order,â€� he said. about 60 members from aibmac district units, including mathura and varanasi, participated in the lucknow meeting. the vhp-sponsored â€˜bhoomi pujanâ€™ on march 15 in ayodhya and the proposed transfer of land to the ram janambhoomi nyas by the centre were on the agenda for discussion. the meeting also discussed a demand for permission to muslims to â€œoffer namaz and re-building babri mosqueâ€� since the same concessions were proposed to be given to the majority community members.â€œbut the demand was dropped as it too was in violation of the supreme court order,â€� said the aibmac convenor. the aibmac will hold statewide demonstration if the vajpayee government gave permission for the march 15 programme and transferred acquired land to begin the temple construction. â€œif permission was granted then we will be left with no alternative than to move the supreme court seeking a ban on their programmes,â€� warned jilani charging the central government with not fulfilling its constitutional duties. the aibmac is awaiting the outcome of the all-india muslim personal law board meeting in delhi tomorrow before initiating any legal proceedings. it will meet again on march 14 to decide their future course of action on both the contentious issues.",0,0,0,0,0

new delhi: the bjp-led central government has begun exploring the possibility of permitting â€˜bhoomi pujaâ€™ at ayodhya, after the kanchipuram shankaracharya on thursday night promised a high-level meeting chaired by the prime minister that, if allowed, he would ensure the ceremony would be â€˜â€˜symbolic, without building materials, carved pillars or concentration of karswewaksâ€™â€™. the shankaracharya has already conveyed this to the all-india muslim personal law board, and said that the question of handing over the so-called undisputed land will be dealt with after march 15, but their response is forthcoming. government sources said besides ensuring the security situation in ayodhya was conducive, muslim approval was essential to â€˜â€˜sellâ€™â€™ the â€˜pujaâ€™ to the bjpâ€™s allies and the opposition. meanwhile, vhp cadres have not taken kindly to ashok singhalâ€™s promise in his capacity as managing trustee of the ramjanmabhomi nyas that the court verdict in the ayodhya case would be obeyed. the promise may have made it possible for the government to consider allowing the â€˜pujaâ€™, but vhp cadres see it as a sell-out. and so on friday, vhpâ€™s international president vh dalmia took two steps back: he said the vhp would obey the court verdict, but if it went against the rjn, the â€˜dharmacharyasâ€™ would decide the next step. asked if he was not contradicting singhalâ€™s statement on thursday that if the verdict went in favour of the muslims, the garbha griha (sanctum sanctorum) location would be changed, he evaded a direct reply, only repeating that he was certain the verdict would be favourable to the rjn. much spadework behind the scenes is understood to have been done by spiritual leader sri sri ravi shankar. the guru reportedly held extensive discussions with vhp leader ashok singhal and persuaded him to give the clearest possible written commitment that his organisation will abide by the court verdict. sri sri ravi shankar is also said to be holding parleys with a cross section of muslim leaders to find a durable settlement to the ayodhya crisis. while dalmia began the â€˜â€˜damage controlâ€™â€™ process, vhp joint general secretary onkar bhave said the â€˜bhoomi pujanâ€™ would be incomplete without shifting building materials, carved pillars and at least 2,000 karsewaks. â€˜â€˜we are still bargaining with the government on this,â€™â€™ he said and added that the vhp still wanted an assurance on the handing over of the acquired land before march 15. simultaneously, 14 bjp mps from up held out a veiled threat of confrontation with the government. in a letter to the pm on thursday, they said the â€˜â€˜anger among people is increasing, and soon it would be manifested against governmentâ€™s hitler-like tactics on streets.â€� minister hints at lifting of curbs.",0,0,0,0,0

lucknow: the vishwa hindu parishad (vhp) on thursday gave a call for a countrywide bandh on march 1 in wake of the ghastly torching of ram sevaks in godhra (gujarat). the organization said it would abide by the courtâ€™s decision on the ayodhya issue, while simultaneously maintaining that transportation of the carved pillars to the disputed site would begin on march 15. it has also announced the holding of â€˜shraddhanjali sabhasâ€™ from february 28 to march 3 at all district headquarters of the vhp. one such sabha was held in lucknow on thursday. addressing a press conference, the vhp kshetriya sangathan mantri and up-uttaranchal in-charge purshottam narain singh said the organization and the sant samaj would abide by the courtâ€™s directives on the controversial ayodhya issue and in the same breath said that one lakh ram sevaks would begin the task of transporting pillars from march 15, the deadline set by the vhp for temple construction. he added that the ruling of the court should come soon and expressed confidence that it would be in favour of the vhp. however, singh tied himself in knots when he said that muslims were responsible for setting fire to three bogies of the sabarmati express which resulted in the death of 14 children, 16 women and 27 men, but could not explain what enabled him to come to the conclusion. by way of explanation he said the incident was part of a pre-conceived conspiracy as the incident took place after the train had passed through a muslim-dominated area. the vhp leader slammed prime minister atal behari vajpayee and union home minister lk advani for asking the vhp to take the â€˜andolanâ€™ back and for placing obstacles in the movement of the ram sevaks, but maintained a studied silence when queried if the stand of the two leaders on vhpâ€™s ayodhya andolan was anti-hindu. he also came down heavily on caretaker chief minister rajnath singh for sealing the borders of ayodhya and putting the ram sevaks to great hardship. he remarked that the present atmosphere in the temple town was reminiscent of the times of mulayam singh yadav.",0,0,0,0,0

lucknow: even though the vhp has given in writing to maintain status quo at the disputed land in ayodhya, no one is ready to take the vhp undertaking seriously. there are several instances in the past, including demolition of babri mosque on december 6, 1992, when the vhp did a volte-face. contradicting statements emanating from the vhp camp are only adding to the confusion. a senior vhp leader, who was part of crucial deliberations in delhi, himself admitted this when he told the times news service that â€œthe agreement does not hold any meaning until signed by the prime minister and others involved in delhi talks.â€� and no written agreement has so far reached in this regard. â€œwhy should we take talks seriously then?â€� quipped the vhp leader. in fact, through the undertaking, the vhp seems to have laid a trap for the prime minister so that vajpayee is forced to get clearance from nda allies for handing over the 43-acre undisputed land to the ram janambhoomi nyas (rjn) by june 2, the last day of 100-day ongoing â€˜purna ahuti yajnaâ€™. and vhp undertaking is not for a song. the barter is that the pmo would expedite the ayodya court cases and agree to accept their three main demands viz â€” symbolic â€˜shila pujanâ€™ at the undisputed land on march 15; handing over of 43-acres of undisputed land by june 2 and withdrawal of forces/lifting of ban on entry of ramsevaks in temple town. the vhp gameplan is to start the temple construction on 43-acres of land so even if court verdict goes against them, the physical possession of the disputed land remains with them. â€œthe prime minister had gone back from his words once. we want to put everything in black and white this time so that the entire nation comes to know who backtracks,â€� disclosed the senior vhp functionary pointing to pmâ€™s lies on so-called earlier talks. the delhi declaration is yet to be signed and made official. but vhp is not relying on what went on in delhi in the last three days. senior vhp leaders have been directed to rush to the temple town to go-ahead with arrangements for march 15 programme of taking carved pillars to the disputed site. however, the vhp would take a final decision on the march 15 programme in a meeting of 51-member mandir nirman samiti to be held in ayodhya a day before. â€œwhether or not we perform symbolic â€˜shila pujanâ€™ or take all carved pillars to the disputed site as originally planned, will be decided by the samiti members on march 14 after taking into consideration the response from the pmo on our three demands,â€� warned the vhp leader. the veiled vhp threat is a serious concern for all. in the past too they had gone back from their promises. â€œpeople of the nation have not forgotten 1992 babri mosque demolition. how could they be trusted?â€� points jafrayab jeelani, convener all-india babri masjid action committee. â€œmembers of the the mandir nirman samiti would perform the â€˜pujanâ€™ to purify the land. â€˜shila pujanâ€™ would begin once carved pillars are consecrated at the temple construction site,â€� disclosed a vhp fuctionary about march 15 programme. the vhp has cleverly turned the table on the prime minister â€” a 1990-like confrontation or a peaceful symbolic â€˜shila pujanâ€™ on march 15 â€” vajpayee has to select one of the two conditions. and either way, the vhp seems to have scored over others during delhi negotiations, turning its face-saver into a victory even after a climb down.",0,0,0,0,0
6,33,"ahmedabad: the violence-hit state of gujarat was gradually returning to normal prompting authorities to focus on relief of 56,000 people rendered homeless in the communal orgy. army continued to patrol sensitive areas, though no major untoward incident was reported from riot-affected districts of panchmahal, surat, baroda, ahmedabad, sabarkantha, mehsana, banaskantha and kheda in the last 24 hours, police said. the curfew, which was imposed in over 40 places, was being gradually relaxed, though night curfew remained in force as a precautionary measure, they said. in ahmedabad city, night curfew was in force in five police station areas, police added. rising steadily, the toll now stands at 667, including the 62 persons who died in the attack on the sabarmati express on february 27. two persons were stabbed in ahmedabad on thursday one of whom later succumbed to injuries, showing that the violence which entered its second week was still far from over. the stabbings took place on relief road, one of the busiest market places of the city. official sources said the death toll in the attack on the train at godhra had risen from 58 to 62 with the death of four persons who were seriously injured in the attack which sparked off widespread reprisals across the state. figures available at the police control room in the state capital state that 820 persons with serious injuries were still admitted to various hospitals, many of them in a critical condition. almost 157 of the deaths have taken place in stabbings and the rest have succumbed to burn injuries and gun- shots. ten bodies were recovered from a village well at ajanwaga in godhra district on wednesday. the victims were reportedly taking shelter in a primary school when they were surrounded by a mob and thrown into the well. official statistics say that 99 persons have been killed in police firing. the security forces have fired 5,176 rounds of ammunition on mobs as well as 7,276 teargas shells. as many as 2,459 houses, 2,082 shops, 1,084 cabins and 448 vehicles, including 12 buses, have been set on fire. additional chief secretary ashok narain said: ""the toll is going to be higher because more bodies are being found."" at the same time, the situation is largely quiet in gujarat over the last two days, but for stray incidents of violence in ahmedabad and other parts of central gujarat. in the chota udepur area of vadodara district, where a policeman who was escorting some families to safety was shot by his own rifle by a mob on tuesday, the situation is said to be still very tense. a spokesman for the army''s corps of electrical and mechanical engineers (eme), which is deployed in vadodara, said one column of the army was sent to chota udepur on thursday evening to control the situation on the request of the state government. the sudden spurt in the death toll from 544 to 607 between wednesday and thursday is the result of many more bodies having been found in godhra and the count being revised in ahmedabad. official figures suggest that in ahmedabad, as many as 28 more deaths have been added to the tally during the 24 hours, taking the total death toll in the communal flare- up in the city alone from 243 to 271. but there was no official explanation available for this upward revision. in godhra, the figure was up from 59 dead on wednesday to 69 on thursday. this excludes the 58 dead in the train burning incident. in sabarkantha, the figure of those dead has gone up from 30 to 34. well-placed sources said bodies in isolated rural areas still remain to be searched. related storiesÂ gujarat gradually returns to normalcyÂ choice of judge for probe opposedÂ gujarat congress wants modi booked under poto

kolkata: the first casualty of the left frontâ€™s protest is invariably the people of kolkata. the leftists, protesting the ayodhya crisis and gruesome events of gujarat, organised two rallies, on wednesday, bringing traffic to a halt and inviting snide remarks from the bjp. left front chairman biman bose read out a resolution before front supporters at the shahid minar maidan, after which the two rallies wound their ways through the streets, one to the north and the other to the south, throwing the afternoon traffic completely out of gear. interestingly, bimanâ€™s resolution avoided any direct mention of the communal killings in gujarat, except for one reference to the godhra incident which they described as â€œheart-rending and of grave concern.â€� instead, in a rather indirect reference, the resolution held kar sevaks responsible for â€œsome recent incidents and tension.â€� the resolution said that the gujarat government was helping kar sevaks reach ayodhya. â€œsuch an assembly can never be said to be for religious purposes.â€� as there was no popular government in uttar pradesh, the centre must direct the state government to keep the situation in ayodhya under control. reacting to the rallies, state bjp president ashim ghosh said that it was â€œstrangeâ€� that the front had organised protests condemning the gujarat incidents, but had never reacted to the repeated cycle of violence in jammu and kashmir. he termed the rallies organised by the left front a â€˜political move.â€™ putting up a rather weak defence of the gujarat governmentâ€™s role in preventing violence, ghosh said that the attack on sabarmati express was so â€˜suddenâ€™ that the local administration was caught off guard. bjp on budget the west bengal unit of the bjp is on the defensive on some of the proposals in this yearâ€™s union budget. on wednesday, it sent a request to union finance minister yashwant sinha that these proposals be rolled back. state bjp president ashim ghosh told reporters in kolkata that the state unit of the party had held a number of seminars on the budget. people were clearly unhappy. â€œit is on the basis of the feedback from these seminars that we have sent our proposals to the finance minister.â€� the state bjp demanded that the increase of rs 40 in gas cylinder prices be reduced to rs 20, the price rise by five per cent on urea and by rs 1.50 on a litre of kerosene be withdrawn and special interest rates be announced for pensioners and â€œhard pressed peopleâ€�. â€œwe are hopeful that the finance minister will consider the proposal if different states make similar requests. he may announce a rollback while replying to the debate on his budget,â€� he said. though he stressed that the cutback in subsidies was in accordance with the terms of the wto agreement, â€œa process which had started during the previous regimeâ€�. observers said the state bjp unit was finding the budget uncomfortable because it had hit the rural population hard.

8,47,"new delhi: the uncertain political situation in up, which is under the central rule despite a new legislative assembly having already been elected, may settle for good two controversial issues. one, whether the governor is under an obligation to invite the leader of the single largest legislative party alone to form the government. two, whether the sc judgment in the s r bommai case is the only yardstick to gauge the situation to impose president''s rule under article 356 of the constitution. the bommai judgment had come on a batch of petitions challenging the constitutional validity of dissolving the assemblies of four bjp-ruled states in the aftermath of the demolition of ayodhya mosque. the states so brought under central rule had duly elected leader of the legislative party. certain states did not have any law and order problem, yet its dissolution was upheld by the court. ""any state government which pursues unsecular policies or unsecular course of action acts contrary to the constitutional mandate and renders itself amenable to action under article 356,"" the constitution bench had ruled. but, governor vishnu kant shastri''s recommendation for president''s rule in a situation, which was hypothetical during the bommai case hearing, can be challenged but without ""legally sustainable arguments"", says lawyer c s vaidhyanathan. ""there can be no ground to seek the court''s intervention against president''s rule in up...the decision cannot be challenged as mala fide as shastri has offered equal opportunity to all the leaders to form he government,"" agrees another lawyer, ashok arora. similarly, senior advocate vishwa nath saraf says:""the facts and circumstances which led to the bommai judgment were different. the principles laid down in the bommai judgment such as of the floor test to judge the majority cannot be applied in up as leaders of different political parties have to prima facie satisfy the governor that they yield requisite support."" since coalition governments are no more alien to the parliamentary form of democracy, the up case may well negate the argument that leader of the single largest legislative party alone can and should be allowed to form the government. though bsp is the third largest party, its leader, mayawati, who has resigned from lok sabha, may still be invited to form a ""stable"" government if she satisfies the governor that she has the support of the bjp and some other legislators. if mayawati is invited, it would establish that it is not the prerogative of the leader of the single largest party alone to form the government. and that the governor is under no constitutional obligation to invite such a leader who cannot satisfy him that he can form a stable government. that the floor of the house has to be the sole ground to test the strength may be the only requirement, where a government is already formed, but that may not be permissible when a leader merely claims that he would be able to form a ""stable"" government.

patna: coal and mines minister ram vilas paswan on friday condemned the intransigence of the vhp and accused it of â€œcreating an unnecessary tension in ayodhya over ram mandir issueâ€�. â€œthis has resulted in the killing of innocent people amid communally surcharged atmosphere throughout the country, particularly in gujarat,â€� paswan added. he was talking to mediapersons here at jayprakash narayan international airport, on his his arrival from delhi on a dayâ€™s visit to patna for addressing a meeting of his outfit, the dalit sena. he said the entire atal behari vajpayee government is â€œcriticising and condemning vhp for its stand on the construction of ram mandir that violates the order of the judiciary regarding maintenance of status quo on the issue.â€� vhp, he said, should not make the construction of ram mandir at ayodhya an issue when the matter is pending in the court. its setting of the deadline for starting the temple construction from march 15 has generated the tension, he added. paswan condemned the burning of train passengers in godhra and subsequent killing of a large number of people in gujarat. the union government has deployed army to control the ugly situation, he said, adding that the army must deal with the situation firmly. â€œdeployment of the army in riot-affected areas to control internal strife has created a problem as the country needs them urgently to protect our borders in view of the surcharged atmosphere there,â€� he said, and appealed to both the communities to shun violence and create communal harmony for the sake of unity and integrity in the country. paswan refuted the allegation that the vajpayee government was responsible for creating such a situation because of mishandling of the ayodhya issue. he said the union government, from the very beginning, made it clear to the vhp that the matter was in the court and solution to the vexed issue must be found either by consensus or wait for the court verdict. he expressed surprise over the stand of the vhp that the government should hand over a portion of land to ram janma bhoomi trust for the construction of the temple. â€œhow can the government give possession of disputed land to a particular trust when the matter is in the court. it will antagonise another section,â€� he said. paswan ridiculed the vhp for making the temple issue more and more serious and also for complicating such a sensitive matter by pressing for the construction of the temple. â€œnot only the people of the country, but many members of the vajpayee government who were on the forefront for the temple construction, are more serious about ram bhagwan. sadly, the vhp is creating tension in the name of construction of temple for bhagwan ram,â€� he lamented.",0,0,0,0,0

vadodara: its citizens say vadodara is truly a cosmopolitan city that recovers as soon as it burns. and now, they are taking pride in the fact that it provided one of the first instances of a city getting back on tracks after violence spread across the state, proving its cosmopolitan nature. having borne the brunt of the post-godhra violence for over a week now, its denizens say that the city has proved the saying that tragedy brings out the best in humanity. the cosmopolitan attitude of people has ensured the spirit of ''quami ekta'' prevails over communal hatred and situational prejudice. facing communal disturbances after a decade, the city seems to only enforce its policy of live and let live. and the phenomenon was evident not just in protected townships like ipcl, ioc, ongc or gsfc, but even in the sensitive areas. rekha rastogi, a bank employee from makarpura, said, ""many people in our area are convinced that the disturbances were caused by outsiders, not people from here. gujaratis are a peace-loving community and cannot possibly cause much harm and damage."" as a result, there is collective sympathy towards those affected by the riots. mrinalaini raman, a resident of sahyog society, helped her maid, from the minority community, by keeping her valuables safe for her. ""she wept as she told me that her electricity and water supply were snapped. then, her home got destroyed. it is our duty to help people in distress,"" she said. maybe so much optimism after chaos seems too good to be true, but city residents as a whole believe that is the time to use minds and start working positively instead of banking on impulsive reactions. said nimita jadeja of ellora park area, ""vadodara will retain its cosmopolitan culture. even if there have been scars on its unified status, they should be taken as a sign of wounds that are healing. soon the pain associated with them too will lessen and things will be normal."" but much also needs to be done to ward off existing prejudice. according to parthiv desai, a teacher residing at karelibaug, ""the sad issue is that children are being hostile to the minority community. i had to explain to them that good and bad people exist everywhere and that need not be based in religion. the solution is that they have to be corrected immediately.""",0,0,0,0,0

mumbai: the vhp, which claims that ayodhya is like its mecca, madina and rome, wonâ€™t deign to ask what the residents of this mecca feel. but thereâ€™s one group of crusaders who have decided to do just that. fed up of â€œsitting by like cowards, waiting for doomsdayâ€™â€™ kumar prashant, journalist and close associate of jayaprakash narayan during the â€˜sampoorna krantiâ€™ movement in bihar, a few senior gandhians such as thakurdas bang and a band of young members of the rashtra yuva sanghatan (made up of jpâ€™s followers), decided it was time to intervene in the dispute. after a year of preparation, they decided on a long march which would begin at raj ghat and culminate on january 30, gandhijiâ€™s death anniversary, in ayodhya. their proposal to the residents of ayodhya was simple: â€œayodhya ka faisla ayodhya ke haath.â€™â€™ this was the message they spread on their delhi-ayodhya yatra as they passed through meerut, aligarh, mathura, agra, kanpur, lucknow, allahabad, benares, azamgarh and faizabad. the concept seemed odd to everyone. â€œhow can ayodhyaâ€™s residents decide on such an important matter?â€™â€™ was the reaction of many. prashantâ€™s answer was â€œwho can? do the vhp or the babri masjid action committee represent us?â€™â€™ â€œlet the court decide,â€™â€™ was a common refrain, but prashant found that fraught with danger. â€œthe judges have to decide whether a ram temple existed at the very spot where the babri masjid stood. both sides have presented truckloads of documents. it will take the court years to go through them. besides, the vhp has already said it wonâ€™t accept the verdict. is any government likely to force them to accept it? should the credibility of the courts be allowed to be eroded? this is a political battle, should we force the court to resolve it?â€™â€™ ayodhya had become a money spinner for all concerned, says prashant, pointing out how the two lawyers representing both sides travelled to court together and shared a cup of tea after the daysâ€™ hearings. except of course for the people of ayodhya, who have been adversely affected. hindus control the temples and the trade and both these depend on pilgrims. â€œsince 1992, the number of pilgrims has come down to 10 per cent of the original. there are no cooks left in some temples because there arenâ€™t any pilgrims.â€™â€™ the team found the people of ayodhya living in terror, â€œthe terror of the hindutvavadis and the mahants, who move around with commandosâ€™â€™. at a function organised by the team,ayodhyaâ€™s children depicted republic day by showing parliament house flanked by a trishul dripping blood on one side and a bombthrowing terrorist on the other. â€œthe people of ayodhya have to decide the matter because their lives depend on it,â€™â€™ said prerna desai of the team. â€œneither can they give their children a good education, nor can they concentrate on their business. they have to be on constant alert 24 hours day.â€™â€™ it was difficult at first to hold joint meeting of the two communities. in a muslim meeting, youth asked angrily whether the team thought the demolition legal, and if they didnâ€™t, didnâ€™t justice demand that the babri masjid be rebuilt there? the teamâ€™s answer: â€œundoubtedly, but how? will you be able to build it without taking the majority community with you?â€™â€™ the same reply was made to the hindus. â€œthereâ€™s no way the government can allow the vhp build the temple there. the supreme court judgment, the nda allies, wonâ€™t allow it. if the temple has to be built, you will have to convince the muslims.â€™â€™ the consensus that emerged was that both places of worship should be built on the spot. the team had a strong argument favour of this: â€œeven if we agree that the idols of ram were not planted inside the temple but suddenly appeared there (in 1949), what does that mean? why did ram lalla choose a masjid appear in? because he felt masjid was the purest place him. and nobody threw him out. such was the maturity ayodhyaâ€™s residents that they accepted that in a masjid, ram lalla can stay, and in a mandir, the koran can be kept.why should let outsiders divide them now?â€™â€™ but how does one keep them out? that was the question mathura too. â€œwe have accepted both mosque and mandir side side for centuries,â€™â€™ mathuraâ€™s residents told the team.â€œbut what we do once the outsiders start coming?â€™â€™ â€œdonâ€™t let them,â€™â€™ was the answer. drawing from gandhiâ€™s model of decentralised democracy, the team worked out a plan form mohalla-level committees made up only of locals, who would decide matters and neutralise the power of political parties. ayodhyaâ€™s dalits remained aloof from the dispute, which is why the team felt they had to have a major role in such committees. after 20 days of intensive discussion, on january 30, both communities came together at a public meeting organised by the team the first time in 10 years. â€œit is now up to the rest of us to strengthen the hands of ayodhyaâ€™s residents,â€™â€™ says prashant, as his team leaves once again for ayodhya keep up the campaign. can the people of ayodhya solve the ayodhya dispute?",0,0,0,0,0

29,91,"new delhi: a group of citizens has requested the chief justice of india to use the supreme court''s inherent powers to intervene in the ongoing mobilisation of temple-building crowds at ayodhya.

the alternative may be a repetition of what took place in 1992, when a similar mobilisation of anti-mosque crowds went totally out of control and the court and the nation were faced with a tragedy that was not supposed to happen, but could have been easily foreseen, notes the appeal.

it has been signed by artist vivan sundaram and academic prabhat patnaik, and journalists nikhil wagel, teesta setalvad and javed anand, and several other eminent persons.

the consequences of inaction and submitting to the threats of bodies like the vhp have been on tragic display over previous days, at godhra, at ahmedabad and elsewhere, it says.

the group has separately asked for dismisal of the gujarat administration and restoration of normalcy to be entrusted to the army, besides the identification and punishment of those responsible for the killings of the past few days.

in a separate meeting, here in delhi on sunday, a group of senior muslim representatives, who included the imam of jama masjid and the head of the jamiat ulema-i-hind, appealed to muslims to maintain unity and to the government to immediately stabilise law and order in gujarat. it also resolved to have a delegation meet the president, the chief justice of india and the chairman of the national human rights commission, in this regard. besides, it has asked for generous compensation to the kin of those killed.

another group of citizens from different religions ^ nirmala deshpande, valson thampu, syeda hamid, etc ^ met prime minister vajpayee to request a number of measures to stop the spreading cycle of violence and despair. they asked for the dismissal of those responsible for allowing the collapse of law and order in gujarat, an immediate and impartial probe into what happened and how and to ban groups creating communal tension in ayodhya. the pm, they said, was polite, but didn''t quite agree with the recommendations.

aligarh: senior state congress leaders, led by its president prakash jaiswal and legislature party leader pramod tiwari, were on wednesday prevented from entering the curfew-bound riot-affected areas of the city. they were detained and later released. tiwari later demanded a â€˜â€˜time-bound judicial inquiryâ€™â€™ headed by a sitting high court judge to probe the recent incidents of violence in the city. he said the decision of the district authorities to allow a procession of vhp and bajrang dal leaders to move through the sensitive areas of the city, one day before the call for a nationwide bandh by the vhp, was a â€˜â€˜fatal mistakeâ€™â€™. he said the bjp leaders in up were â€˜â€˜frustratedâ€™â€™ by their dismal performance in the assembly elections and thus they sought to whip up communal passions here to raise the temperature in the state. tiwari said during the recent communal violence in gujarat and other parts of the country, both prime minister atal behari vajpayee and union home minister l.k. advani appear to have abandoned their constitutional obligations and were behaving purely as party functionaries. he said the district authorities here should take â€˜â€˜urgent stepsâ€™â€™ to provide relief and essential commodities in the curfew-bound areas of the city. tiwari said a congress delegation would meet the state governor on thursday to demand payment of compensation of rs 5 lakh to the next-of-kin of each of the three victims of the recent violence here.congress leader wasim ahmad and pcc general secretary naseem parhan were also part of the congress delegation.earlier in the morning, the district authorities relaxed curfew in a phased manner for one hour.",0,1,1,0,0

the performance of the bharatiya janata party and its allies in three of the four states (in manipur, the party has a nominal presence) was not unexpected but none had thought that it would touch so low. however, the grace with which it has accepted the defeat, even if as part of a strategy, is likely to yield dividends. nevertheless, it might not be able to balk the political cataclysm at the centre. despite having been rebuffed by the bjp for being an â€˜undependable commodityâ€™, the poll results have exhibited that (1) mayawati is the undisputed leader of the most backwards, (2) defections and splits do not affect her party and (3) single-handed, she is capable of taking on even the best-organised parties. in fact, it is she and she alone who came in way of mulayamâ€™s dream of an absolute majority. but, more than anybody, she is also responsible for the phenomenon in which instead of casting votes, the people have voted castes. and mulayam singh, by staking claim for power, has almost walked into the â€˜parlourâ€™, specially prepared by his political adversaries. even if he succeeds in cobbling a wafer thin majority, he would have to do everything he has been attacking the bjp for. the state exchequer being almost empty, from where will he get the money to run the administration and fulfil the promises made by him and his party to the people? besides, the march 15 deadline of the vishwa hindu parishad is quite close and he may have to face a 1990-like situation again. or, may be mulayam has resolved to take on the â€˜communalâ€™, forces squarely and give an opportunity to other â€œsecularâ€� parties to either side with him openly or hang themselves. * * * the press under review which had put almost all its eggs into the basket of a particular party and which is naturally jubilant at the defeat of the bjp, will, however, find it difficult to sing praises for the congress or the defection game without which no party, unless two of the major ones join hand, can even present a semblance of a working majority. holding the up elections as an exercise in futility, in dinon (25/2) asserts: now there are only two alternatives, the presidentâ€™s rule or fresh elections - a very costly affair. the governor has vast powers and he can save the situation at least for six months, adds the daily. highlighting the fact that now the bjp rule has shrunk to four small states of goa, jharkhand, himachal pradesh and gujarat, jadeed amal of the same day argues that since the bjp has fought the elections on the slogan ofâ€�vote atal ko, vote kamal koâ€�, its defeat indicates that the prime minister has lost his charisma. the daily however, welcomed the results as in its opinion the people have sagaciously reposed their faith in secularism and have undone the mistake they had committed in the previous election. reacting to the new political scenario in a broader perspective, rashtriya sahara wants the bsp to do nothing which might disappoint its muslim voters who have voted it with the hope that it will not ally with the bjp. it hopes that after the down fall of the bjp, the secular partners of the nda, who are there due to political compulsions, will come to the conclusion that to sail in a wrecked boat will not be a wise move. adeed amal has, in a mild manner, hinted at the limitations of the sp in the number game. â€œthe congress cannot sail it through â€”â€” and so far as the small groups and independents are concerned, the old game of horse - trading may be resorted to again. * * * overshadowing the poll results, the president while opening the budget session has reiterated the governmentâ€™s resolve to maintain status quo at ayodhya and the stand that any talks with pakistan can be resumed only after it stops backing terrorism in kashmir. in dinon and sahafat (20/2) have hailed the governmentâ€™s resolve.",0,0,0,0,0

ghodasar-jinjhar (kheda): on saturday last week when a mob attacked his home in ghodasar village and set some 112 houses on fire, 55-year-old hidusa diwan sent a message to his 21-year-old recently-wedded son, rajabsa, ""you leave, i have collected all the money and will be burying it close to our wheat field."" for easy location, the father told him that the area would appear freshly dug. rajabsa, who had taken refuge at jinjhar village, some three kms from ghodasar gathered all his guts and returned to the wheat field two days later looking for his father. what he saw was horrifying. ""there were tracks in my field like as if a mob had run across, i followed them and found this ... ,"" he breaks down, pointing to the charred remains of his father. but hidusa had kept his word. rajabsa found buried nearby some rs 10,000 stuffed into a polythene bag and even showed us the site! on wednesday, when tnn visited the area the police had found 13 bodies of ghodasar residents brutally slaughtered while attempting to flee on sunday with the burnt remains of their belongings simmering in the wheat fields around jinjhar village. three of these bodies were found dumped across the shedhi canal nearby. after a headcount of the villagers who had escaped, they claimed there was a list of 45 persons still missing, said rajabsa. but the police say, all have been located, either dead or alive. if anyone thought that the ''chun chun ke maarenge'' theory was only for bollywood pot-boilers, the trail of death and destruction between ghodasar and jinjhar proved its manifestation in real life. over 58 houses had been burnt down, borewells that watered the fields and earned kheda the sobriquet of gujarat''s ''greenest district'', were damaged, and several stacks of hay destroyed leaving no fodder for the cattle. the police collected the relatives of the victims and decided on a spot to give them a decent mass burial. but not many of them wanted to go through the gruesome task after seeing the state of the bodies, found three days after the homicide. ""let them be buried where they are,"" one suggested, amid protests. the night of february 5, also brought an end to the small world of 62-year-old navrangkhan balukhan pathan when he found the body of three of his brothers in their respective wheat and aniseed fields. according to pathan, ""two of my brothers pirumiyan (75) and anwarmiyan (55) were mute and had hidden in these fields to protect their goat and other belongings and were burnt alive."" ""we were screaming when the mob came, but they could barely hear,"" he added. ironically, pirumiyan''s goat came in the afternoon looking for its master and was seen quietly nibbling grass around his body. the third brother mohammadmiyan balukhan pathan''s body lay slit at the throat, again, in his own portion of the field, the charred remains of his belongings strewn about. says deputy superintendent of police r m parmar, ""looks like, those who stayed behind to look after their belongings were the ones that lost their lives."" the vessels and burnt mattresses scattered about the fields only show that they had hidden there not expecting such a bloody encounter.",0,0,1,0,0

new delhi: the union cabinet met late on thursday evening and recommended presidentâ€™s rule in uttar pradesh, even as bsp leader mayawati resigned her lok sabha seat and hinted at a new proximity to the bjp as a prelude to a new pact for ministry-making in the state. this comes in the wake of no party in the state being being able to demonstrate to governor vishnukant shastri that it had the backing of the requisite number of mlas to form a stable government. parliamentary affairs minister pramod mahajan said the cabinet, after discussing the governorâ€™s report, agreed to endorse his recommendation for presidentâ€™s rule which has been sent to the president for his approval. thereafter, it would have to be ratified by parliament within 60 days. when asked how the government proposed to get it through the rajya sabha, mahajan said, â€˜â€˜let us wait and see.â€™â€™ this statement, along with the press conference mayawati held earlier in the day along with her mentor kanshi ram, before submitting her resignation to the speakerâ€™s office, is being seen as a sign that the 60 days are not being kept for parliamentary approval but to stitch up a bsp-bjp alliance led by mayawati. at the briefing, after announcing her resignation from the lok sabha, mayawati said she was leaving for lucknow to lead her party legislators and cadres. this is also being read in political circles as an effort to scotch rumours that she might accept a central berth, in return for the bsp extending support to a bjp-led government in up. interestingly, both mayawati and kanshiram welcomed the up governorâ€™s decision to recommend presidentâ€™s rule in the state for the time being and admitted they had been meeting bjp leaders. adding credence to the possibility of some understanding having been reached between the bjp and the bsp, mayawatiâ€™s comments on ayodhya and the communal carnage in gujarat were muted. indeed, the position she took on the cause of the gujarat violence and the centreâ€™s handling of the ayodhya situation revealed a pro-bjp tilt in sharp contrast to the bsp line in the assembly elections. replying to a question on the ayodhya tangle, mayawati said that while the disputed land should remain with the centre until the court verdict, the so-called undisputed land around the site could be handed over for temple construction. â€˜â€˜we have no objection to that,â€™â€™ she said. mayawati said she had told the prime minister at the all-party meeting on the gujarat situation that since the train attack at godhra had sparked the trouble, there should be an inquiry into the incident as well as the subsequent communal riots. instead, she took a swipe at the congress, saying, â€˜â€˜the ayodhya problem had begun with the shilanyas during congress rule.â€™â€™ she ruled out the possibility of either seeking support from mulayam singh yadavâ€™s samajwadi party or backing its efforts at government formation. she evaded answering a question on the demand to ban the vishwa hindu parishad, saying, â€˜â€˜let there be an all-party meeting on all communal organisations and an inquiry into their activities â€”we have to rise above political considerations to decide an issue like that.â€™â€™",0,0,0,0,0

41,24,"new delhi: in view of the volatile political situation confronting the country, the ruling national democratic alliance (nda) may look for a successor to lok sabha speaker g m c balayogi, who died in a helicopter crash in andhra pradesh sunday morning, from within the telugu desam party (tdp) to maintain the delicate political equilibrium at the centre.

this is because of the pivotal role of the tdp, which is the second largest party supporting the ruling nda. also, tdp chief and andhra pradesh chief minister n chandrababu naidu enjoys excellent rapport with prime minister vajpayee and the nda leadership.

political observers say the ruling alliance would do nothing to disturb the current political equilibrium at a time when the bjp has suffered in the recent assembly elections and is facing all-round criticism for the handling of the violence in gujarat.

deputy speaker p m sayeed would be conducting monday''s proceedings in the lok sabha. he was the congresss nominee who garnered opposition support to win the post. chances of his elevation to the speaker''s post are considered slim since the ruling alliance would not like to be seen to be surrendering the crucial parliamentary post to the opposition.

among the names being mentioned for the speaker''s post are tdp''s leader in the lok sabha yerran naidu, m venkateswarulu who was minister in the united front government, and m rajaiah, a leading tdp member who, like balayogi, is from backward class. yerran naidu is considered close to the chief minister and was his nominee in the united front governments of deve gowda and i k gujral. he is also among the more experienced of the tdp members in parliament.

incidentally, yerran naidu was the first choice of chandrababu naidu when the party was offered the lok sabha speakership in 1998. his flight from hyderabad was delayed, forcing the tdp to nominate balayogi to beat the deadline for nominations. the opposition was battling for the post, challenging the fragile ruling alliance, which lacked majority support. balayogi''s nomination brought the tdp into the alliance.

a surprise choice and a low-profile man, balayogi was the first dalit to become the lok sabha speaker. he is also the first to die in office. during the three years-plus in office, he belied his critics who had accused him of being unknown and faceless. he handled the business of the house with sensitivity and was re-elected speaker in 1999.

he displayed fairness during the crucial vote that brought down the vajpayee government by a single vote in 1999. he permitted the then orissa chief minister giridhar gomango, who had continued to be a lok sabha member during the six-month period stipulated for allowing him to choose his legislature, to vote on the no-confidence motion against the government. his critics in the nda questioned the political propriety, but could not question the action on legal grounds. the opposition found his dealing of the matter fair.

the speaker''s post is crucial in the country''s constitutional and parliamentary firmament. more so when a coalition government is wielding power at the centre. notionally, the speaker ceases to be member of the party on whose ticket he/she is elected to the lok sabha. the role becomes more important each time there is an impasse between the government and the opposition on any issue. he plays the referee in the political match, without being seen as taking sides.

considering the importance of the post balayogi held and the volatile political situation the country is passing through, top leaders of the government and the opposition would be attending his state funeral.

ahmedabad: the cradle of india''s freedom movement is locked out. gory scenes of violence, arson and killings seem to have shocked the sabarmati ashram to closed its doors to the world. the apostle of peace is perhaps forgotten in all this frenzy. a white wooden gate, that on other days welcomes visitors from country and abroad, has remained locked since thursday noon, possibly the longest break that the gandhi ashram has taken in the recent past. the huge compound of the ashram-cum-museum â€“ a heritage monument that conjures images of mahatma gandhi and his non-violent struggle â€“ was steeped in silence on friday. the only activity in the sprawling premises was frolicking squirrels having a field day in the deserted campus. ""we had to close down the ashram because of the tense situation,"" said amrutbhai mody, the secretary of the sabarmati ashram trust. the other convincing factor was that local residents were using the compound to have a look across the sabarmati river at all the smoke billowing out of the burning buildings. scenes of violence, arson and looting were plainly visible and the number of curious onlookers was steadily growing. afraid that the ashram could be damaged by the rampaging vandals and to put a stop on such ""misuse"" of gandhian premises, the trustees have decided to keep the ashram closed till the tension is defused. renowned gandhian chunibhai vaidya, who stays across the street from sabarmati ashram, says, ""the ashram is an epitome of peace and secularism. we cannot allow it to be used for watching violence and killings of fellow men."" ""i am shocked at the gory incidents. undeterred mindless mayhem and break down of law and order suggests that the gujarat violence is under the aegis of the state government. i am unable to contact george (fernandes) or the chief minister. it is still a mystery why despite police and army presence, there is no concerted effort to put an end to this violence. even the media has ignored my appeals to restore peace in the city,"" vaidya said. ""neither the godhra incident can be pardoned nor the selective killings of ahmedabad. i just was told that no less than 50 bodies have been recovered from the bapunagar-himmatnagar area. the inhuman happenings seem a throwback of the partition days. ahmedabad is now a breeding ground for bitter animosity between two communities."" when ahmedabad was gripped by similar circumstances in 1992, albeit of a lesser intensity, vaidya along with more than 1,000 gandhians and localites had organised a peace march. but, this time the situation is more grave and vaidya has not yet been able to do an encore. prakash shah, a gandhian, told tnn: ""a public initiative is definitely called for to calm down the frayed tempers and this unnecessary violence, but present circumstances are not conducive. the state authorities no more take public initiative or intervention kindly unless the idea is generated from within the party rank and files or from the government offices. i had hoped that narendra modi would be on a firm footing after his electoral victory from rajkot-2 but he has turned out to be a complete failure."" the gandhians'' displeasure on the goings on in gujarat was reflected in the deserted premises of sabarmati ashram. ganpatbhai parmar, the only security guard of the ashram, says: ""gandhiji''s ideologies and teachings may have been forgotten in the state, this area between wadaj till the sabarmati ashram has always been alien to communal tensions. closure of the ashram at this juncture has been done as a precautionary measure."" but, with the growing levels of devilry, can one ever be sure?",0,0,1,1,0

mumbai: the mohalla committee movement trust has complimented the city police, especially joint commissioner (law and order) v.n. deshmukh, for its confidence-building measures during the recent communal tension.

in a letter to mr deshmukh, executive chairman of the trust julio ribeiro said, ``the situation was very tense after the horrendous act of savagery reported from godhra and we were apprehending acts of retaliation on people not connected with that barbarism. you have dispelled such apprehensions by holding meetings with mohalla committee members and leaders of variouscommunities and exercising strict vigilance, especially during the friday prayers.''''

condemning the violence in gujarat, the activists said, ``what is happening in gujarat is unacceptable in a civilised society and condemns us to the depths of barbarism. what we are most concerned about is that not only did the state fail in its duty to control fanatics but it also stood by looking helpless while these forces unleashed violence and terror on members of minority communities. this happened in delhi after mrs gandhi''s assassination in 1984, in bombay in 1992-''93 and is now happening in gujarat. while we strongly and unequivocally condemn the torching of the unfortunate kar sevaks in godhra, we cannot accept retaliatory action, especially when the state is seen as acquiescing in the act of revenge.''''

in 50 years of involvement with law, iâ€™ve found that a settlement through negotiation is far better than one through litigation. at the end of many litigations, both parties have felt theyâ€™ve lost. in a settlement, thereâ€™s a prospect of both feeling theyâ€™ve won. even the supreme court, in dealing with the issue of the acquired land, asserted that an amicable settlement would be the ideal solution. the shankaracharyaâ€™s formula is a step in that direction. it is based on the ground situation and the parameters laid down by the sc which classified the acquired land into two categories: the 2.7 acre disputed land, where the mosque stood; and the land whose title was undisputed. these 43 acres are with the ram janmabhoomi nyas and other hindu owners. the sc upheld the government acquisition as a transitional measure, and clarified that the muslims had no claim or objection except to the 2.7 acres. it also stated that, for the time being, the title vests absolutely in the central government, which can consider how much land was required for access to the disputed land by the muslims in the event of their winning the case. who wins and who loses is under judicature. but thereâ€™s no dispute which canâ€™t be mutually settled. in this case, the parties are not only those in the allahabad high court case but the whole nation. the demand for a temple is widespread. but the demolition of the mosque has emotively surcharged the situation. it was possible to keep the mosque as it stood and build a temple on the undisputed land. now we have a controversy which is tragic in a country whose civilisation teaches us the cardinal principle of live and let live. i think both communities will be in consonance with their tradition if they accept shankaracharyaâ€™s formula â€” with such variations as may be necessary. it may be better to appoint an interlocutor who commands the confidence of different communities. the shankaracharya, sri sri ravi shankar and non-partisan individuals can create a climate of reason and reciprocity. and political parties must not make matters worse for votebank calculations. for, national issues can be solved only with a national perspective. shankaracharyaâ€™s is one way of resolving the impasse. thereâ€™ll always be detractors but they must be marginalised. the national mainstream today wants a peaceful, sane solution. and its viability will depend on its broad acceptance. the communities must understand that the nation, its harmony, its future is of paramount importance. so let us not stand on rigid positions but come to a solution which makes india win. that the formula found acceptance with important muslim leaders proves its reasonableness. itâ€™s a practical formula because the disputed land can be kept intact, and if the muslims win the case, the centre can consider whatâ€™s essential for access to the 2.7 acres. the court can be asked to hasten the proceedings. a solution seems in sight as the formula offers a clear ground for an interim solution and has the potential for a long-term one. the formula should not be viewed in a controversial spirit. if the spirit of give and take prevails, the hindus and muslims of india will surely find a solution to live together, in a spirit of fraternity. we cannot have a recurrence of godhra or gujarat. it dehumanises us all and diminishes us as a nation. and the muslims as much as the hindus must understand that they have an overriding duty to the nation they belong to.

pune: even as gujarat burned in the aftermath of the godhra killings, communally-sensitive mumbai remained peaceful. this has been attributed in large part to the prompt action taken by the 30-odd mohalla committees which have been set up to ensure that religious sentiments do not flare up as they did in the past. pune, too, has been following the example of mumbai by nurturing the mohalla committee movement. the city has no history of sustained communal rioting; the worst was in 1965 during a ganpati festival; others have been confined to pockets of the city. while the anatomy of a communal riot is very complex, and whether a city falls victim to it or not depends on several factors, the mohalla committee concept is one well worth pursuing. around 30 mohalla committees exist throughout pune. they were set up in the wake of the devastating communal conflagration that engulfed neighbouring mumbai ten years ago. ""the 1992 riots in mumbai were a iesson for us and we decided that pune should not become like mumbai. we earnestly started contacting neighbours and soon had excellent co-ordination, not only with the police, but also the municipal ward officers and corporators,"" says gita vir, member of the koregaon park mohalla committee. the mohalla committee, she says, tries to build up a sense of belonging in a community. this creates a feeling of unity and hence of security. as the events of gujarat proved last week, the participation of the police would be crucial. deputy commissioner of police (zone one) vinod lokhande, who supervises the ''communally sensitive'' areas of the city, confirms that the once a month meeting of all mohalla committees is extremely useful in maintaining harmony. ""we urge members not to give vent to their anger no matter what happens. we also teach them precautionary measures, how to defuse rumours and when to alert the police,"" lokhande says. essentially, the mohalla committee members could be the voice of reason that is required when the mischief starts. seventy-nine-year-old anantrao vavhal is an active member of the cantonment mohalla committee. in april last year rumours about stone pelting and burning of the quran were doing the rounds and it was essential to defuse the situation. ""an angry mob had gathered and we were worried about what would happen. so we took some of the community leaders to the spots where the outrage was supposed to have occurred and showed them that nothing had actually happened. the tension slowly defused,"" vavhal says. rajni behel is a member of the uday baug mohalla committee and used to work in a mohalla committee when living in mumbai. ""we have already created an excellent atmosphere in the locality and the rule is we mention only our nationality. religion is kept inside the home and we don''t allow public displays of religious ceremonies,"" she says. she is worried, though, that young people are not taking an interest in this activity, a sentiment echoed by vavhal. vir would like much more participation from the public. there are many retired police officials and ex-servicemen who can get involved. ""in mumbai, people like (former police commissioner) julio ribeiro have devoted themselves to the movement and it has paid rich dividends."" mohalla committee members in pune say that the police have always been extremely co-operative. julio ribeiro told times news network that ""no police officer wants communal trouble in his area, so the police always encourage such initiatives"". in mohalla committees he is involved with in mumbai, the police are encouraged to participate in health camps and computer classes to build up a feeling of trust among minority communities. ribeiro says every major city must have mohalla committees irrespective of whether it has a history of communal riots or not. ""recently, noted billiards player geet sethi requested me to go to ahmedabad with him so that we can start the movement there. we plan to go this week and start the good work,"" says the former ''super cop''. he also sounded a word of caution when it comes to recruiting people into the committees.

hyderabad: telugu desam party leaders feel that the wife of the late lok sabha speaker g m c balayogi should be nominated to the rajya sabha. according to senior leaders, the issue is likely to figure in the crucial politburo meeting scheduled to be held at the ntr trust bhavan on saturday evening. they feel that this would be the best tribute to balayogi who died in a helicopter crash on march 3. the general opinion in the party is that sending her to the rajya sabha would help them in two ways. one, people of balayogiâ€™s constituency would feel happy that the government had acted on time and, second, she being a political novice would be spared of hectic political battle in the byelection, particularly when she has yet to come out of the trauma. more over, the political situation at the centre being fluid, it may not be wise to ask her to contest for the byelection to the lok sabha. party leaders say that if the tdp was forced to withdraw support to the nda at any stage, she may have to face two elections in quick succession. asked if the tdp was considering withdrawal of support to the nda, party sources said the tdp would continue to support the government as long as it does not deviate from the nda agenda. the sources said â€œas of now, the situation was fluidâ€�. the tdp has made its stand clear that the centre should maintain status quo at the disputed site in ayodhya at any cost. however, the main focus would be on the candidate for the lok sabha speaker and the candidates for the rajya sabha. replying to a question, the source said that there was no question of giving up the partyâ€™s claim for the post of the lok sabha speaker. â€œin fact, the bjp too wants that the tdp should put up its candidate. the party however is upset over the manner in which â€œcertain senior leadersâ€� are lobbying for the post,â€™â€™ the sources said.",0,0,0,0,0

86,234,"new delhi: fish rots from the top, and if the ugly events unfolding in gujarat over the past four days are any indication, the same holds true for governance too. even after four days of senseless violence, gujarat chief minister narendra modi is yet to reassure the five crore people of his state that he is the guardian of their lives and property. the past four days have made it clear that the dividing line between the government, the police, the bjp and other fronts of the sangh parivar like the vishwa hindu parishad and bajrang dal have got totally blurred in gujarat. asked about the violence, modi quoted newton''s third law - ""every action has an equal and opposite reaction"" - to virtually justify what is happening. in the case of the lynching of former congress mp ahsan jaffrey, he was quick to point out that it was jaffrey who had first fired at the mob. he forgot to say what a citizen is expected to do when a menacing mob, which has already slaughtered many, approaches him and the police has deliberately not responded to his pleas. when the attack on the train took place on february 27 and the vhp called for a bandh, gujarat bjp president rajendrasinh rana was quick to announce the state bjp''s support for the strike, giving clear signals to the administration that it need not take a hard line against those who enforce the bandh. by noon on thursday, shops owned by muslims were broken open in ahmedabad, rajkot and other cities even as the police looked the other way. at many places, the police mingled with the vandals and pleas for help went completely unheeded. while vadodara police imposed curfew early in the morning, the police commissioner of ahmedabad took time in following suit. it is easy to blame the police commissioner, but there are clear indications that his hands were tied by the minister of state for home, gordhan zadaphia, who has risen from the ranks of the vhp. zadaphia is a supporter of the international general secretary of the vhp, pravin togadia, at whose insistence the home portfolio was given to him when modi became chief minister. it was only when the situation had gone sufficiently out of hand that the police tried to intervene. but by that time, it was too late and the mobs had swelled to enormous proportions. the sparse police presence looked like a drop in this ocean of violence. and what did the chief minister have to say about what was happening? he said, ""the five crore people of gujarat have shown remarkable restraint under grave provocation."" he went on to blast the godhra killing of kar sevaks while brushing aside the equally brutal retaliation that was taking place against muslims. if the central government was speaking about not allowing vhp activists into ayodhya, modi said that police protection should be given to them en route. if the people of gujarat were expecting a reassuring face, what they got was a sangh pracharak on television who has perhaps forgotten he is now chief minister. incidentally, modi has yet to see mobs because he has not visited the worst-affected areas. if only he had the courage shown by george fernandes, who carried on his tour of the riot-hit areas despite being mobbed and stoned.

mumbai: former mumbai police commissioners such as julio ribeiro, satish sahney and r.h. mendonca are the leading lights of the mohalla committees that have put pressure on the police to maintain peace and harmony.

``it is important for citizens to monitor and criticise the police leadership,'''' says mr ribeiro, who also served as director-general of thegujarat police during the 1984 riots in ahmedabad. he managed to curb the riots by promptly locking up the vhp rabble-rousers as well as the criminal elements in the minority community, bootleggers and gambling den owners.

taking mr ribeiro''s argument further, mr sahney says that civil society ought to realise that it needs a permanent mechanism outside the administration to diffuse crises arising out of communal problems. the mohalla committees set up in mumbai after the post-babri riots are one such mechanism. in fact, their effectiveness has been boosted by the fact that they are also apolitical.

one way in which civil society has kept up the pressure on the mumbai police is to pursue the implementation of the justice srikrishna report. ``policemen must be made to realise that they will have to face the consequences of their biased and unprofessional conduct,'''' says shakil ahmed of the nirbhay bano andolan, which monitors police functioning in the slums.

r.d. tyagi, joint police commissioner of mumbai during the post-babri riots, was booked in 2001 for his role in the suleiman bakery firing case of 1993 despite being rewarded with the mumbai police commissioner''s post in 1995. this was largely possible because of the persistence of grass-roots activists such as mr ahmed.

islamic scholar asghar ali engineer, who has studied several communal riots in india, admits that the resolve of civil society rather than the recommendations of inquiry commissions is what tends to prevent riots. ``the gujarat police has not improved a bit despite the strong condemnation of its role in the 1969 riots in ahmedabad,'''' he points out.

if the mumbai police has done some introspection after the 1992-''93 riots, the credit goes to mumbaikars who made their displeasure clear. ``we acknowledged that we had a problem and went in for sustained treatment,'''' says mr sahney, who is credited with bringing police-muslim relations on an even keel after 1993.

meanwhile, citizens have also realised that their safety lies in maintaining cordial relations with their neighbours. ``mumbai muslims will no longer react to events in a knee-jerk manner,'''' says congressman husain dalwai, citing the manner in which the urdu press here has consistently ignored rabble-rousers.

""we find that he himself is not getting involved, he should have been pro-active and gone around appealing for peace which he has not done, he should have visited the most-affected areas during the last one week which again he has not done,"" raval said. the governor''s report is eagerly awaited even though the contents are never made public by the raj bhavan or the union home ministry, which receives it because it may fuel pressure from the nda allies for dismissal of the modi government for alleged complicity in the riots and delayed reaction to contain the situation. opposition leaders said there was a need for the governor to be ''objective'', but ""this was too much to expect from bhandari given his pro-bjp track record"". a raj bhavan spokesman denied these charges and said, last wednesday, when the godhra massacre took place, the governor had issued an appeal for peace and communal harmony. since then bhandari is in touch with the chief minister and chief secretary and is getting reports on the situation twice a day. the spokesman denied that the governor was sending ""any special report"" this month and said the report on law and order in the state was a ""monthly routine"". asked when bhandari plans to tour the affected areas, the spokesman said, ""we are still watching the situation"".",0,0,0,0,0

""nowhere else is the bjp in such power; nowhere else are the vishva hindu parishad and rss so strong."" he and congress chief whip pranab mukherjee, who initiated the debate, as also other opposition members who spoke demanded to know what moral justification chief minister narendra modi had to continue in office. reading out one statement after another of state cm narendra modi as the bloodbath proceeded without let-up, on how things were basically under control and how the mass violence was quite understandable, pranab asked the ruling party if this was their conception of a cm''s job. he and others went on to ask home minister advani if he had measured up to his job at all. clearly not, they said. bjp''s gopalsinh solanki, an mp from gujarat who was chosen to lead the debate from the bjp side, said modi''s administration had actually done a commendable job. the situation was brought largely under control in a little over 72 hours. contrast this, he said, with the congress record of controlling mass violence in the riots of 1969, 1980, 1985, etc., when places remained under curfew for weeks, and even months. later, union law minister arun jaitley made an allied point: data showed the police had actually arrested close to 4,000 rioters over the first five days of violence, and shot dead 98 rioters. against this, he said, the november 1984 anti-sikh pogrom in delhi, then under congress rule, 3,000 people were massacred in one day with the police twiddling their thumbs. jaitley said he condemned the post-godhra rioters and killers without any reservation. it was an inhuman act and it is solely for the police and the government to punish anyone for a crime, not any citizen''s self-appointed task. but so much of the criticism was based on hearsay and falsity, as in the common belief about cm modi having said the violence was an equal and opposite reaction to the godhra killings, when he had never said anything of the sort, jaitley said. stop scoring cheap political points if you want a proper introspection, he said, to approving thumping of desks by advani and other bjp members. the decision to discuss actually took half the day. the entire morning sesion was drowned in shouting and counter-roars, leading chairman krishan kant to twice adjourn the house, with nothing done or decided. sanity prevailed only a little before lunch, with the discussion proceeding after that. kapil sibal of the congress called for a judicial inquiry into gujarat violence and demanded the dismissal of modi, accusing him of connivance in the carnage. mohammad azam khan (sp) created a stir by asserting that if such killings went on, the muslims would have to rethink about their future. advani had no right to continue in his office, he said and sought president''s rule in gujarat.

mumbai: while the nation expects the supreme court to solve the ayodhya tangle, the controversy over a temple and madrasa in old khar village here refuses to die despite the high court ordering the demolition of these roadside structures. on monday morning, the police had to be called as a precautionary measure after nearly 100 protestors, led by two local mlas, gathered outside the temple.the demolition had been ordered more than a month ago by a high court divison bench comprising justice a.p. shah and justice vijaya kapse-tahilramani but it was only on saturday that the civic authorities pasted the demolition notice on the structures. â€œwe give a 48-hour notice prior to demolition but the job can be done any time after that,â€™â€™ said j.b. gupta, the officiating asistant municipal commissioner of hwest ward. he said the temple would be demolished as soon as the police gave them protection. the petitioners, the federation of h-west ward citizensâ€™ associations, told the court that the two structures, which had been put up by local residents, had not been demolished despite a series of complaints to civic and police authorities. old khar village is a â€˜gaothanâ€™ which has been taken over by garment shops after the popularity of the nearby linking road as a readymade clothes centre. based on the correspondence they had with the authorities over a period of two years, the federation alleged that the khar police station was in cahoots with shiv sena activists and a local political leader who had built the temple and the madarsa respectively over the last two years. according to the petitioners, the khar police station repeatedly denied police protection to the civic demolition squad under one pretext or the other. the petitioners also said they apprehended a threat to the life of local resident edwin britto, who had initiated the complaints. mr britto had already been attacked once by vested interests in 1999. â€œi suspect that an effort is being made by the encroachment mafia to whip up communal passions so that the police gets a convenient excuse to delay the demolitions,â€™â€™ alleged anandini thakoor of the local mohalla committee. advocate pradeep havnur, lawyer for the petitioners, contended that the small temple blocked the lane leading out of old khar village and had been put up with the purpose of slowly encroaching on the road. as for the madrasa, the petitioners claimed it was an illegal structure which housed a garment manufacuring unit. the police was present at the spot for nearly two hours but no arrests have been made. senior inspector sanjay jambulkar of khar police station played down the incident as a â€œminor matterâ€™â€™ and said there was no threat to mr brittoâ€™s life.",0,0,1,1,0

pune: even as gujarat burned in the aftermath of the godhra killings, communally-sensitive mumbai remained peaceful. this has been attributed in large part to the prompt action taken by the 30-odd mohalla committees which have been set up to ensure that religious sentiments do not flare up as they did in the past. pune, too, has been following the example of mumbai by nurturing the mohalla committee movement. the city has no history of sustained communal rioting; the worst was in 1965 during a ganpati festival; others have been confined to pockets of the city. while the anatomy of a communal riot is very complex, and whether a city falls victim to it or not depends on several factors, the mohalla committee concept is one well worth pursuing. around 30 mohalla committees exist throughout pune. they were set up in the wake of the communal conflagration that engulfed neighbouring mumbai ten years ago. â€œthe 1992 riots in mumbai were a iesson for us and we decided that pune should not become like mumbai.we earnestly started contacting neighbours and soon had excellent co-ordination, not only with the police, but also the municipal ward officers and corporators,â€� says gita vir, member of the koregaon park mohalla committee. the mohalla committee, she says, tries to build up a sense of belonging in a community.this creates a feeling of unity and hence of security. as the events of gujarat proved last week, the participation of the police would be crucial. deputy commissioner of police (zone one) vinod lokhande, who supervises the â€˜communally sensitiveâ€™ areas of the city, confirms that the once a month meeting of all mohalla committees is extremely useful in maintaining harmony. â€œwe urge members not to give vent to their anger no matter what happens. we also teach them precautionary measures, how to defuse rumours and when to alert the police,â€� lokhande says. essentially, the mohalla committee members could be the voice of reason that is required when the mischief starts. seventy-nine-yearold anantrao vavhal is an active member of the cantonment mohalla committee. in april last year rumours about stone pelting and burning of the quran were doing the rounds and it was essential to defuse the situation. â€œan angry mob had gathered and we were worried about what would happen. so we took some of the community leaders to the spots where the outrage was supposed to have occurred and showed them that nothing had actually happened. the tension slowly defused,â€�vavhal says. rajni behel is a member of the uday baug mohalla committee and used to work in a mohalla committee when living in mumbai. â€œwe have already created an excellent atmosphere in the locality and the rule is we mention only our nationality. religion is kept inside the home and we donâ€™t allow public displays of religious ceremonies,â€� she says. she is worried, though, that young people are not taking an interest in this activity, a sentiment echoed by vavhal. vir would like much more participation from the public. there are many retired police officials and ex-servicemen who can get involved. â€œin mumbai, people like (former police commissioner) julio ribeiro have devoted themselves to the movement and it has paid rich dividends.â€� mohalla committee members in pune say that the police have always been extremely co-operative. julio ribeiro told times news network that â€œno police officer wants communal trouble in his area, so the police always encourage such initiativesâ€�. in mohalla committees he is involved with in mumbai, the police are encouraged to participate in health camps and computer classes to build up a feeling of trust among minority communities. ribeiro says every major city must have mohalla committees irrespective of whether it has a history of communal riots or not.â€œrecently, noted billiards player geet sethi requested me to go to ahmedabad with him so that we can start the movement there.we plan to go this week and start the good work,â€� says the former â€˜super copâ€™. he also sounded a word of caution when it comes to recruiting people into the committees. â€œonly honest and sincere people who have a good character and no political ambition must be chosen.â€� â€¢faraskhana : 13 (70 meetings at chowkis) â€¢vishrambaug : 43 (79) â€¢khadak : 19 (112) â€¢deccan : 21 (65) â€¢kothrud : 7 (63) â€¢samartha : 10 (45)",0,0,1,0,0

vadodara: the closure of about 80 per cent industrial units in panchmahals district in central gujarat in the wake of the train carnage at godhra on february 27 and its aftermath is likely to spell a disaster for the owners of these units. according to bhupendra parikh, vice-president of the forum of industries association & chambers, production and trading have come to a standstill due to the riots which resulted in the blockage of huge amounts of money. talking to tnn on sunday, parikh, who owns an engineering unit near jarod on vadodara-halol highway, said that 80 per cent of the total workforce in about 1,200 units located in the district have gone back to their native places and are too scared to return. he said workers belonging to the minority community are so frightened that they have stopped coming out of their houses, forget reporting to work. even owners of some industrial units have not bothered to inquire about the fate of their units. one reason behind this was the imposition of curfew in these areas. halol, kalol, godhra, lunawada, santrampur and kadana towns were the worst hit in the riots. harish sheth, managing director of kalol-based gujarat setco clutch limited, told tnn that soon after the eruption of violence most workers fled to their native villages bringing production to very low levels. his unit supplies clutches to big names like the tatas and also exports them to the uk and us among other countries. sheth put the production loss at his unit due to large-scale absenteeism at rs 1.25 crore. the thin presence of workers in other units in the district too have affected output. according to former deputy union minister of commerce and former mp from godhra parliamentary constituency shantibhai patel, most industries bore the brunt of the flare-up. both parikh and patel put the production loss in panchmahals district alone at several hundred crores of rupees. several industries located here are major contributors to the country''s export basket, said parikh. the movement of raw material and finished goods was affected due to the disruption of transportation services, said parikh, adding that the non-arrival of raw material will adversely affect production. parikh, however, said that industries could make up for the production loss by working overtime provided the situation becomes normal. if normalcy does not return early it could hit export and domestic orders. the halol-kalol belt, which attracted a large number of industrialists from mumbai and other parts of the country soon after the discovery of crude oil in the ankleshwar oilfields in the 60s, is sensing tough times ahead which could have a deep impact on the economic growth of central gujarat. general motors, abs plastic and safari are some of the well-known companies which have their units in the district. it is feared that several industrialists may be forced to think over the option of shifting their units to safer places like chhatisgarh, hyderabad and bangalore. for the revival of these industries, parikh raised several demands including extension of the time limit by three months for the payment of income-tax and excise duty, raising the limit of letter of credit, banks deferring the recovery of interest amount by two months and extending loans to industries towards payment of employees'' salaries.",0,0,0,0,0

thiruvananthapuram: the asian development bank (adb), which has a bailout plan for the pauperised kerala, has denied it signed a memorandum with the state government, but the opposition swears the bank has. the issue gains importance as the withdrawal of some privileges to the employees __ the cause of the current strike __ is said to be part of the adb conditions of restructuring fiscal management. the adb was to give massive development loans of an indefinite sum to kerala. the previous leftist government had begun the negotiations in 1998 but the deal was not clinched. opposition mla p.c. george promised the assembly to show papers to prove the antony government had signed the agreement soon after it was sworn in in may last.

116,355,"new delhi: law minister arun jaitley on thursday refuted the opposition charge that police and administration had not acted promptly to control communal riots in gujarat. intervening in a discussion on gujarat incidents in rajya sabha, jaitley said police arrested nearly 4000 rioters during the first five days and fired 2000 rounds to control the situation. as many as 98 people were killed in police firing, he said. the minister said the epicentre of the riots was godhra incident where innocent people travelling in a train were killed. he appealed to members to help in cooling down the atmosphere and not inflame it further by emotional and baseless statements and by creating a fear psychosis. jaitley, who represents gujarat in the house, said the situation in the state could have been brought under control quickly if all sections of people, including the media, had behaved responsibly. the minister referred to a newspaper report quoting gujarat chief minister narinder modi as saying that according to newton''s law of motion to every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. jaitley said the chief minister had not made this remark and had sent a written denial to the newspaper, but the damage had been done. similarly, he said, the prime minister had not said as alleged by a member that they did not want votes of a particular community. this allegation had been denied by the prime minister''s office but was still being made by members, jaitley said. the house witnessed acrimonious scenes when the minister tried to compare the role played by police and administration in gujarat to 1984 anti-sikh riots in delhi. jaitely said the members were forgetting what had happened in delhi in 1984 when nearly 3,000 innocent people were killed in one day and neither police nor army was deployed by the then government to control the situation. compared to the 1984 situation, he said, the government and police in gujarat had acted promptly and tried to control violence. this led to a strong protest from agitated opposition members, especially shabana azmi (nom), sarla maheshwari, jibon roy (both cpi-m) and suresh pachauri (cong) who asked the minister not to compare the two incidents. joining them, swaraj kaushal, whose haryana vikas party is supporting the nda government, said jaitely''s comparison was ""bad"". the minister said he was not comparing the two riots but only referring to an earlier similar situation. denying the opposition charge that police had acted in a partisan manner, jaitley said police had rescued members of the minority community in as many as 20 places,including 400 in panchmahal district alone. jaitley appealed to opposition members not to indulge in ""blame-game"" and work unitedly to cool down tempers and bring the situation to normal. he said the opposition would not be able to achieve its political aim as the government was not going to accept their demand for the removal of the chief minister. the maturity of indian society, he said, would be judged not by blaming one another but by learning from what has happened in gujarat so that such incidents do not recur. he appealed to the members, especially those belonging to the minority community, not to create a fear psychosis in the country.

mumbai:the maharashtra legislatureâ€™s budget session begins here on wednesday amidst unprecedented security, tumultous developments in gujarat and ayodhya and the state governmentâ€™s precarious survival continuously threatened by a small group of mlas belonging to smaller parties. the shiv sena-bjp alliance gave a hint of its intransigence on tuesday by boycotting the customary tea party hosted by the chief minister on the eve of the session. â€œwe will expose the democratic front (df) government at every possible opportunity,â€™â€™ opposition leaders narayan rane, gopinath munde and nitin gadkari told a press conference. the session will begin on wednesday with an address by governor p.c. alexander to both houses of the legislature. finance minister jayant patil will present the annual budget on march 22. the first part of the session will conclude on march 28. the house will reconvene on april 22 and sit till may 3, according to the programme decided by the business advisory committee (bac). the ruling df is on its toes since the saffron alliance is determined to pull it down by persuading mlas belonging to the smaller parties to withdraw their support of the df government. smaller parties are unhappy since they were ignored by the congress and the nationalist congress party (ncp) in making 12 nominations by the governor to the upper house. they do not see eye to eye with the two major partners on several issues, like enhancing the water and power tariffs. sensing this, the alliance is planning its strategy. â€œwe will ensure that smaller parties go farther from the df,â€™â€™ mr munde remarked mischievously, when asked about his remark that the df governemnt would collapse soon under its own weight. security arrangements will be very strict in view of the terrorist attack on parliament on december 13 last year. even at that time, it was hinted that mumbai would be a prime target. sensing the threat, deputy chief minister chhagan bhujbal has ensured that nothing is left to chance. for the first time, high metal barricades have been installed around the periphery, making vidhan bhavan almost impenetrable. moreover, entry to the house has been restricted. no visitors will be able to enter the precincts under the proposed arrangements. neither ministers nor legislators will be permitted to lead their bands of admirers and supporters, unlike in the past,when most legislators made it a point to show off their fan following. while the opposition sena-bjp alliance is in a buoyant mood following its impressive performance in municipal and zilla parishad (zp) elections, the df regime is receiving one jolt after another. for instance, mr alexander refused to sign an ordinance that sought to curtail a mayorâ€™s term to one year from the present two and a half years. the governor did not appreciate the haste since the session was just three days away. earlier, he insisted that the allocation of outlay in the budget should be based on the developmental backlog determined by an expert committee. under the constitution, the state cabinet had no choice but implement his fiat. â€œwe are worried of the political fallout of the new allocation formula,â€™â€™ a senior df minister admitted candidly though he did not want to be named. he said many ongoing projects would be hampered for lack of budgetary support because of the formula. the opposition has no dearth issues. a serious drought, a half century of communal riots and persistent load-shedding across the state for up to eight hours daily are some of the issues opposition leaders will highlight in the house. in addition, efforts to woo the smaller parties which have supported the df government are underway.",0,0,1,0,0

""we find that he himself is not getting involved , he should have been pro-active and gone around appealing for peace which he has not done, he should have visited the most affected areas during the last one week which again he has not done"", raval said. the governor''s report is eagerly awaited even though the contents are never made public by the raj bhavan or the union home ministry which receives it because it may fuel pressure from the nda allies for dismissal of the modi government for alleged complicity in the riots and delayed reaction to contain the situation. opposition leaders said there was a need for the governor to be â€˜objective'' but ""this was too much to expect from bhandari given his pro-bjp track record"". a spokesman of raj bhavan denied these charges and said last wednesday , when the godhra massacre took place , the governor had issued an appeal for peace and communal harmony. since then, bhandari is in touch with the chief minister and chief secretary and is getting reports on the situation twice a day. the spokesman denied that the governor was sending ""any special report"" this month and said the report on law and order in the state was a ""monthly routine"". asked when bhandari plans to tour the affected areas , the spokesman said ""we are still watching the situation"".

ahmedabad: the allegations regarding possible police inaction and administrative failure during godhra and its aftermath were expected to be allayed, albeit to an extent, by the appointment of a commission of inquiry headed by retired high court judge kg shah. instead, a fresh controversy, a volley of allegations and strong apprehensions have greeted the notification. though most of the criticism revolves around the fact that this inquiry should have been headed by a sitting judge or a panel of sitting judges, a past judgment delivered by justice shah is also being called into question by his critics along with the fact that he has had an association with the bjp government, having been on the panel of lawyers of the state government in the supreme court. justice shah had sentenced five to death, convicting them of burning alive eight persons in dabgarwad on june 9, 1985, during communal riots that followed the anti-reservation protests. however, his judgment was reversed by the supreme court on the ground that ""the finding of the judge... is not based on appreciation of evidence but on imagination"". talking to tnn at his apartment in the judges'' bungalows area of ahmedabad, justice shah seemed unfazed by the opposition to his appointment. ""don''t expect this retired judge, who is in his late sixties, to assure that justice will be done. a judge doesn''t have to assure justice, that''s his duty and that''s why a judicial inquiry is preferred to others."" he is also not in the least bit hassled about the possibility of his report being shelved or commission wound up, as has been the norm in the past. ""looking at the scale of the incidents and the way the government acted...almost promptly issuing the notification...it seems unlikely,"" he opines. commenting on the opposition to his appointment, he observed that ""no appoinment can please all"". he admits that the inquiry will take longer than the three months stipulated. ""i am very clear that it is physically impossible to complete the task in three months. it will be done as expeditiously as possible. but nothing should be expected overnight."" as for the allegations about his political leanings, he said he had never heard of them. he refused to even discuss them further. even the mention of the sensational judgment in the dabgarwad case upsets him. ""don''t even mention that. a judge''s duty is quite difficult...if questions are to be raised like this, how can a judge perform his duty?"" while condemning godhra and its aftermath as ""absolutely brutal acts of large magnitude"", he informs that the inquiry will be a large-scale exercise. but many continue to have apprehensions about his appointment. ""a retired judge should not be appointed to inquire into such a sensitive issue. as was done in 1969, a sitting supreme court judge assisted by at least three other high court judges should be asked to conduct an inquiry within 60 days,"" says former chief minister and congress leader shankersinh vaghela. ""retired judges tend to become dependent on the government and ultimately their reports are shelved,"" he adds for good measure. noted human rights activist and senior lawyer girish patel observes, ""in this atmosphere of terror and fear that prevails in the state after serious communal riots, any commission headed by a local man, however high or independent he may be, will not improve confidence of the people."" he suggests an inquiry by a supreme court judge, after dissolving the state commission.

ahmedabad: if at all one needed another example of the all-pervasive lawlessness in ahmedabad during the communal holocaust, this is it. nobody knows who razed the tomb of one of the best-known urdu poets of the state vali gujarati here and a built a road overnight. many small shrines in the city, destroyed during the frenzy which rocked ahmedabad last week, met with a similar fate. while civic officials admit that bull-dozers, cranes and road-rollers were used in the demolition jobs, none in the congress-ruled ahmedabad municipal corporation or the bjp-ruled state government knows where all the equipment came from or who used them. municipal commissioner p panneervel and mayor himmatsinh patel are now being blamed for allowing these places of worship to be razed after being damaged by rioters. but both these civic heads have clarified that the amc had nothing to do with these operations. at the shahibaug underbridge, rioters demolished vali gujarati''s tomb and a hanuman shrine built over it. it was named ''godharia hanuman temple.'' but, even the temple vanished and today you can literally ride over the plot that has a newly laid road. on february 28, when rioters went on the rampage in the city, a dargah alongside the sarkhej road in paldi-bhatta area too was reduced to rubble. with rare alacrity, the plot was metalled and merged with the adjoining road. in this classic whodunnit, from pannervel to patel, from deputy municipal commissioners to the estate officers of amc, nobody has any inkling on who these fly-by-night ""civic workers"" were. even the authorities of the ahmedabad district collectorate, the public works department, roads and buildings department have washed their hands off. ""these areas fall under amc''s jurisdiction,"" they say. pannervel asserts ""i have sent road construction equipment for annual maintenance. apart from a half-km road-laying exercise at paldi-bhatta area, the amc has not carried out any such operation recently."" while who the culprits were remain a mystery, riot victims are steadfast in their belief that it''s the amc''s handiwork. nanumiya rasulmiya malik confronted the mayor on friday, accusing him of showing disrespect to dargahs and mosques and also targeting shops and houses of riot victims. ""we have elected them to the amc. but now these congressmen are bulldozing vandalised dargahs and converting them into thoroughfares. people now tread over these places of worship,"" thundered malik. in the wee hours of march 6, a jcb was used to demolish baluch, a shop-cum-residential complex on naroda road, opposite the naroda police station. this prime-plot housed three single-storeyed buildings built in 1932 that had been set afire by rioting mobs on february 28. this demolition is as mysterious as the rest. neither the police nor the civic authorities has any inkling as to who demolished baluch. deputy municipal commissioner utpal padia told tnn: ""we have not carried out any demolition ever since the riots. amc has no knowledge about baluch''s destruction."" the same story is repeated in bapunagar, saraspur, gomtipur and ishanpur. in ishanpur, a privately owned crane pulled down a historical mosque. isaq ahmed sheikh, vice-president of al amin garib nawaz hospital trust, says: ""dargahs near the bapunagar water tower and in naroda gam were demolished during the riots. mancha ki masjid in saraspur and another in naroda gam was vandalised by rioters. in most cases, the plots were covered with tar overnight."" a senior amc official revealed that ""chances of collusion between lower amc staff and certain vandals cannot be ruled out. but, none of the workshop log books - that record use of earthmovers, bulldozers and other heavy equipment - show any entries to prove this theory."" then, who were these ""invisible"" civic authorities on a demolition spree ? badruddin sheikh, chairman of amc''s standing committee believes it is the state government''s public works department to be blamed.",0,0,1,0,0

lucknow: as march 15 draws near, the tension in ayodhya and the state is getting to be palpable. all eyes are on the faizabad district administration and how it is going to handle the situation in case the vishwa hindu parishad leaders and the ram janmabhoomi nyas seers decide to press ahead with their plan to perform puja at the undisputed site on that day. although ayodhya is a cauldron on the boil, it seems that the onus for maintaining the rule of law will depend mainly on the district officials, mainly the district magistrate and the senior superintendent of police. for them, the state headquarters sent an important message on monday when an arrest warrant was first prepared for the vhp working president ashok singhal and later withdrawn. he was escorted to raj bhawan and then allowed to proceed to ayodhya. after the kind of treatment accorded to singhal in the state capital, will it be fair to expect the faizabad district officials to arrest him in ayodhya, where the home secretary and the director general of police will be conspicuous by their absence on march 15. already, reports from ayodhya suggest that the dm and ssp there may hesitate in taking any action against the temple movement leaders. justifiably so. in 1990 and 92, the district officials were left to deal with the ugly situation and they later paid a price for what was described as their â€˜laxity'' and incompetence. while the then dgp svm tripathi and the then home secretary played safe and stayed away from the trouble spot, the junior officers had to bear the brunt. from all accounts, the temple movement leaders will enact a face-saving drama on march 15. but just in case the situation goes out of hand, the dm and the ssp apart, there''d be a crying need for the presence of the home secretary and the director-general of police in the pilgrim city on that day, specially when the state is under central rule. executive magistrates, who are not trained in handling law and order situation, would have virtually no role to play. nor will the setting up of make-shift jails have any meaning as was the case in 1990. the detainees in these jails were allowed to go out wherever they wanted for their meals and some people made a lot of money in the process. the home secretary naresh dayal and the dgp rk pandit, despite being â€˜apprehensive'' about the situation in ayodhya, will be ensconced in the state capital. obviously, they do not believe in leading from the front because of the risks involved. with â€˜leaders'' like these, is it surprising that the lucknow zone is without an inspector-general even in the time of crisis.",0,0,1,0,0
157,546,"patna: senior nationalist congress party (ncp) leader, jagannath mishra on tuesday demanded dismissal of the narandra modi government in gujarat for its ""failure"" to contain communal violence in the state. talking to reporters here, mishra claimed that chief ministers of gujarat, uttar pradesh, rajasthan and madhya pradesh had been asked to resign by the then prime minister narsimha rao after demolition of babri masjid in 1992 and the large scale communal violence that followed. a similar situation prevailed in gujarat today and the need of the hour was dismissal of narendra modi government for ""mis-handling"" the situation, mishra said. the ncp would observe march 14 as ''save country day'' to mobilise public opinion in bihar against growing incidents of communal disturbances, he said. mishra said his party at its recent working committee meeting adopted several resolutions condemning the communal violence in gujarat. the party also criticised the ''pro-multinational'' and ''anti-people'' budget of the nda, he added. mishra charged the nda government with going for disinvestment of viable public sector units under the pressure of multi-nationals and big corporate houses of the country. the former bihar chief minister also accused the centre of doing precious little for the economic emancipation of the truncated state. he further alleged that despite promises made by several union ministers including nitish kumar, ramvilas paswan and sharad yadav, the vajpayee ministry had not not done anything for the state which was passing through severe economic crisis.

158,558,"ahmedabad: the traditional trouble spots of disturbances in the walled city of ahmedabad are surprisingly quiet as the fringes of the city are emerging as the new communal hot-spots. it is remarkable, police officials say, that thickly-populated areas like kalupur, dariapur, jamalpur and raipur and khadia have remained relatively trouble-free this time accounting for only six out of a over 300 deaths that have taken place in ahmedabad over the last four days. the bulk of the killings have taken place in meghaninagar, naroda, odhav, amraiwadi and gomtipur. and the reasons are not far to seek. while the communally volatile walled city areas have sizeable population of both communities sharing space, there is also mutual respect for each othersâ€™ strengths as compared to other areas. surprisingly, even as pitched battles were going on in fringe areas of gomtipur and naroda, the womenfolk were busy buying vegetables and fruits in manekchowk in the hub of the city. for the first time perhaps in the history of communal flare-ups of ahmedabad, it is not the walled city areas which are in the news for all the wrong reasons. officials say it could also be â€˜riot fatigueâ€™ as the residents of the walled city have suffered the worst consequences of riots and therefore they have preferred to remain away from perpetuation of violence. when commissioner of police p c pandey was asked for his reaction on the phenomenon, he quipped, ""thank god that walled city remained quiet this timeâ€�. he admitted the fact that the situation would have taken a serious turn had trouble sparked off inside the walled city. in 1969, 1983, 1985 and 1992 the focus of the attention were kalupur, dariapur, jamalpur and the worst hit raipur and khadia which have earned dubious distinction for violence since british period. the bouts of communal orgy in ahmedabad has its roots in the rath yatra taken out from famous jagdish temple located in jamalpur area of the walled city. the first major disturbance was reported in 1946 when ugly clashes were reported between two communities during the rath yatra. according to sources, the riots in large scale started only after tiffs over annual rath yatra procession, except in 1992 when trouble erupted after the demolition of the babri mosque. it is for the second time perhaps that riots have been triggered off on a massive scale during the vhp sponsored gujarat bandh to protest against the killing of ram sevaks aboard sabarmati express, who were returning from ayodhya. unfortunately, despite frequent riots the state administration has not bothered to implement the recommendations made by two inquiry commissions, one appointed after the 1969 riots and the second after the 1985 riots. the report submitted by the reddy commission and the dave commission have been shelved and none of the findings and suggestions made by the commissions have been accepted or implemented so far. â€œneither congress or bjp regime have taken pains to study the recommendations made by these commissions to check the communal disturbances in ahmedabad,â€� a senior minister confirmed on condition of annynomity.

160,571,"lucknow: in a significant move, the centre on wednesday approached the allahabad high court seeking a day-to-day hearing of the case relating to the ayodhya dispute.        read this story in...          Â Â hindi    a petition was filed by the centre before the lucknow bench of the high court comprising justice sudhir narayan, justice rafat alam and justice bhanwar singh praying for a direction that the hearing of the case relating to the dispute be taken up on a day-to-day basis. the court granted time till march 18 to the parties for filing replies to the application while posting further hearing on it to march 19. the application filed before the full bench through additional solicitor general r n trivedi comes in the midst of fresh intiatives taken by the centre to resolve the ram janmabhoomi-babri masjid dispute, especially a day after the kanchi shankaracharya floated a formula for breaking the deadlock. trivedi impressed on the court that under the acquisition act of 1993, the union of india was statutory receiver with the obligation to maintain status quo till the disposal of the suits. it was spending about rs 30 crore annually in this regard, he added. it was submitted that in view of the sensitive issues involved, it would be appropriate if the disputes were resolved as early as possible. the additional solicitor general said so far the testimony of 23 witnesses have been completed. the examination and cross-examination of witnesses sometimes took 12-15 days. zafaryab jilani, appearing for sunni wakf board, objected to the maintainability of the application on the ground that the centre was never a party to the dispute. a manan, appearing for one of the plaintiffs, also wanted to file objections to the centre''s application. r l verma, appearing for one of the parties to the suit also sought time to file reply to the application. trivedi responded that in the dispute between the parties, the union of india was not a necessary party but in its capacity as the statutory receiver it could not be said that the centre had no locus standi to file an application for early hearing. the high court had in 1989 directed that four title suits originally filed before the civil judge, faizabad, be transferred to its lucknow bench for original trial of the case relating to the ownership of the disputed area at ayodhya. all the four suits were now pending before a special full bench of the high court. after the demolition of the disputed structure in ayodhya in 1992, the disputed area and the adjacent area was acquired by the centre under the provisions of the acquisition of certain area at ayodhya act (accaaa), 1993. the validity of this act was challenged in supreme court in 1994, which had upheld the constitutional validity of the acaaa. under section 7 of the act, faizabad divisional commissioner is entrusted with the responsibility of maintaining status quo in the disputed area till the transfer of property is made by the centre on resolution of the dispute to the party found entitled to it in accordance of the final adjudication of the issue by the court. the four title suits for the determination of the true owner of the disputed area were being heard by the court and till its adjudication the centre as the statutory receiver has to maintain status quo, trivedi said. the centre said as statutory receiver it was administering the property in a befitting manner considering the sensitivity of the issue, the threat perception to the makeshift structure and the volatile law and order situation, which was often fuelled and worsened by religious passions. this has necessitated flow and utilisation of huge manpower and financial resources to maintain status quo and law and order in the area and pointed out that government was spending rs 30 crore on the maintenance and security of the area alone, trivedi said. the application also said the centre was holding and managing the additional land measuring 70 acres adjacent to the disputed area to implement the final verdict of the high court. ""in view of the nature of the issues involved, their importance and sensitivity and consideration of national interest, which impelled early resolution of the dispute on an urgent basis, the central government is vitally interested that the suits be decided at an early date,"" it said. related stories:Â kanchi seer postpones return homeÂ kanchi seer offers new peace formula for templeÂ land cannot be given to vhp

ahmedabad: non-life insurance companies face a major hit due to the riots in gujarat. officials from all four public sector non-life insurance companies said that it is still too early to give exact figures as claims are pouring in and assessments of these claims will take some time. but, current estimates stand at about 750 claims valued at about rs 45.5 crore from ahmedabad, saurashtra and north gujarat regions. similar claims may arise from vadodara, surat and south gujarat areas too. but, they also warned that while the claims will be higher, post-assessment the actual insurance payments are going to be lower. as a precautionary measure, all four public sector non-life insurance companies have restricted new insurance underwriting from february 28, the day when the riots broke out. during the ""apprehensive period"", to use insurance language, insurance companies provide new cover only after a thorough and strict inspection. while renewals for the same amounts will be accepted, increase in sum insured will be considered very selectively. ""new india assurance''s (nia) ahmedabad regional office has so far received 206 claims for an amount totalling rs 12 crore. amongst this there are two major claims of about rs 1.5 crore each. the adani group has claimed about rs 1.4 crore for the adani-ravji stores destroyed during the riots. an automobile dealer, milestone, has filed claims for rs 1.5 crore for premises as well as 16-20 cars destroyed during the riots,"" said manoj shah, manager, nia-ahmedabad.

kolkata: sixty five-year-old amit de of long island, new york is not just another winter bird of passage, yielding to an annual bout of nostalgia. he is in the city, no doubt, to brush up old friendships and family ties. originally from sonarpur, he went to the land of opportunity in 1974, and set up practice as a certified public accountant. this year he is on a less mundane and more spiritual mission. de is the president of the new york sarbojonin durgotsav committee, which has been organising the puja at franklin square on long island since 1985. a core group of 10-15 families is the prime mover of the puja and de has come here to take back pratimas of durga and her family. in addition, two extra images of laxmi and saraswati are on his shopping list. unlike mail order pratimas shipped out every year by local artisans for pujas abroad, the long island puja committee have set their hearts on something unusual this year. artist nemai pal of kumartulli, commissioned by de, moulded the traditional images first in clay, then cast them in plaster,and finally, crafted them out of fibre glass. for the headgear and ornaments, he used wrought copper from benaras for its durability. the idols range from four to six feet in height and would obviously need special handling in flight when de carries carries them back with him next saturday. what about the puja itself at the big apple? de sounds expectant, even a little wistful. durga puja will be on a weekend again, from friday (october 11) to sunday (october 13). about 400-500 indians, mostly bengalis from queens, south indians and gujaratis gathre for the puja. the priest, pradipta ganguly, is an accountant, too, with a yen for sanskrit mantras. although the sequence of dates followed do not correspond to the panjika (almanac), the rituals would be no different from those of the para pujas here. anjali would be at 1 pm every day followed by the standard kichuri bhog for lunch. immigrant children like their homespun counterparts, have large appetites and from 4-6 pm pizzas and peanut butter sandwiches would have supplemented the pure vegetarian fare. de admits that the younger people among the expats stay away from the pujas and â€œdo their own thingâ€�.",0,0,0,0,0

lucknow: a day after raising hopes of postponing its march 15 programme, the vishwa hindu parishad (vhp) on saturday took a turnaround rejecting prime minister vajpayeeâ€™s request to call off the agitation. talking to times news network over telephone from ayodhya, mandir nirman samiti chairman mahant ramchandra paramhans das said that â€œthere is no change in our march 15 programme and ram sevaks would go ahead taking carved pillars to the acquired land for worship.â€� the vhp has also issued a similar statement from delhi ruling out any possibility of postponing their march 15 programme. significantly, mahant das, who is also chairman of ram janambhommi nyas, is going to delhi on sunday. he is expected to meet the prime minister and senior vhp and rss leaders to hold final rounds of parleys on the ongoing ayodhya impasse. â€œthe prime minister canâ€™t be trusted anymore. he had lied to the entire nation that talks were on with hindu and muslim leaders. and when it came to taking a decision he changed the track,â€� rued mahant das. mahant das said that he is no more interested in holding any talks with the vajpayee government on the issue now but does not want any confrontation or fall of bjp-led government either. â€œno talks till force is withdrawn and restrictions lifted,â€� he said . i am going to delhi on the insistence of vhp leaders,he clarified. in fact, mahant das is furious over the manner he and other members of the vhp delegation were treated at 7, race course when they went to meet the prime minister on january 27. senior vhp leaders have, however, persuaded him to come to delhi again and hold final round of talks with the central government. â€œalthough there is no change in our programme, we would announce a final decision on march 14 after holding mandir nirman samiti meeting,â€� said mahant das. frantic attempts are being made by senior bjp leaders to persuade mahant das. chief minister rajnath singh had airdashed to ayodhya on thursday. although he claimed to have succeeded in breaking ice , the forefront ram janambhoomi movement leader is in no mood to relent. mahant das was also furious over restrictions imposed by the state administration on movements of devotees and ram sevaks. â€œif muslims could be allowed to pay obeisance at mecca at their will, how can hindus be stopped from visiting ram lala in ayodhya,â€� he quipped. vn arora adds from ayodhya: the number of vhp volutneers coming into ayodhya has drastically reduced following diversion of trains and restrictions on vehicular traffic. only a few fresh batches of ram sevaks could manage to sneak in. about 5,000 ram sevaks are staying in ayodhya till date. district administration, however, put the number to well over 20,000. despite efforts by district administration to flush out ram sevaks, about 2,828 of them are still stranded in ayodhya due to non-availability of trains and buses. meanwhile, the vhp has banned the entry of mediapersons in ramsevakpuram â€” the temporary township where ram sevaks are lodged. the ban came into effect on friday night following fracas between a media lensman and vhp cadre.",0,0,0,0,0

rajkot: union home minister l k advani for the first time in the last five days admitted that the godhra incident was a matter of concern for the central and state governments. talking to reporters here after visiting a small pocket of the riot-torn areas of the city and also after meeting representatives of the bohra samaj and the chamber of commerce, the union home minister said that the godhra incident was a blot on the image of the country. advani said in the last four years wherein the bjp and its allies were in power at the centre, it was a matter of pride for us that there were hardly any communal riots, but the godhra incident has given a bad name to the country. ""it was an horrendous act,"" he added. ""if the killings in godhra were to be condemned, the killing of innocent people in its aftermath was even more condemnable,"" the minister said. he said that after the september 11 wtc attack in the us followed by the december 13 attack on parliament, pakistan was exposed to helping terrorist activities. but, after the meaningless killings in the last five days, even we too have been exposed."" he added that ""immediate steps must be taken to instil confidence in the people"". however, advani denied that the riots had spread due to police inaction. he said ""the cause and reason behind the riots would be found out and analysed"". advani also took a round of the riot-hit areas, where many shops and factories were burnt, and has sought explanation from police commissioner upendra singh in this regard. advani was particularly unhappy at the incident on sunday when a nursing home at paravdi chowk was attacked and burnt down. the owner of the nursing home, dr h b kamdar, told advani that ""it was for the first time that a nursing home was attacked and despite making several calls for help, it did not come"". however, the police commissioner denied any such incident. advani also visited the lati plot where 18 shops of wood were set afire on february 28. the bohra samaj, which was the worst-affected in the riots, also made a separate representation to advani and said that they should be paid compensation. the minister also took a round on the gondal road where a 75-year-old painting shop was set afire by a riotous mob. meanwhile, the chamber of commerce in its representation sought more police force for the city and opening of more police stations in the worst-affected jungleshwar and other areas to protect the industries. the chamber sought immediate assistance from the centre and also adequate police bandobast in future. when asked about the status of the ram mandir issue now that so much of blood has been shed in gujarat, the minister said that ""the stand of the government on ram mandir was very clear. the issue has to be resolved either through an agreement or through court verdict, and every effort is being made to ensure that it is sorted out"".",0,0,1,1,0
193,664,"new delhi: after a series of whirlwind meetings with central ministers, the vishwa hindu parishad (vhp) and muslim leaders, swami jayendra saraswati, the shankaracharya of kanchipuram â€” the latest mediator on the ayodhya issue â€” said that the vhp had agreed to await the verdict of the of the supreme court on the disputed site. but if this appeared like some movement forward, he also seemed to present the nation with a fait accompli by endorsing the vhp stand that bhoomi pujan be permitted on march 15 on the land acquired by the centre in 1993 and that this land should be handed over to the ramjanmabhoomi nyas well before june 2, when the 100 day yagna in ayodhya ends. he asked the muslim personal law board to give its approval for the handing over of this acquired land. what is being presented as a ''concession'' â€” in a letter the ramjanmabhoomi nyas wrote to the prime minister on tuesday â€” is that till the title suit about the disputed 40 by 80 feet spot on which the babri masjid stood is decided, that area will not be touched. but vhp vice president giriraj kishore said no such proposal had been made yet. ""we have not taken any decision. if the proposal comes, the dharmacharyas will decide on it, "" he said. he, however, did reiterate that ""we have said we will not go to the disputed area for now"", adding that the allahabad high court must take a decision in the pending case on the basis of documentary evidence furnished by the vhp and not witnesses. the shankaracharya further stressed that the ram idol would remain virajman at the sanctum sanctorum and the daily puja would continue in the pendency of the title suit. in short, if construction begins on the adjacent acquired land, then there will be no way that the area can ever be restored to the muslims, even if the title suit is decided in their favour eventually, since the construction that will begin will follow the master plan which envisages the disputed spot as the sanctum sanctorum. kishore, meanwhile, ruled out compromise on the three demands made on monday: that all restrictions enforced in ayodhya be lifted, shifting of carved stones to the undisputed site be allowed and the undisputed land be handed over to it before june 2 for construction to begin. on any other issue, he said, ""we have an open mind"". the vhp leader confirmed that both the kanchi shankaracharya and the rss were mediating between the parishad and the government on handing over the undisputed land to them for construction, and hoped the issue would be solved through mediation. any solution, however, had to come by march 12 and the government would have to begin removing hurdles in the way of temple construction, he said. regardless of the government''s stand, he said, material for construction would begin to be moved to the undisputed land at 2.15 pm on march 15, and construction would begin at the site of the shila pujan on any mahurat before june 2, when the 108-day yajna ended. kishore ""appealed"" that the only way communal tension on the issue could be eased was by the ""muslims showing large-heartedness and giving up their claim on the ram janmabhoomi. this will help hindu-muslim unity."" insisting there were no decisions yet from the meetings that the shankaracharya had held, kishore said the kanchi seer was engaged in ensuring that the government hand over the undisputed land to the trust for construction to begin. the shankaracharya too said there was no legal hurdle in the way of the government accepting the demand. the government on its part, was in the process of consulting its nda allies, he said. the ram janmabhoomi trust, he said, had given him a written undertaking that no activity would be undertaken on the disputed site. on the government''s part, he said, the prime minister would consider all issues and put the centre''s stand before parliament. ""everything will be done before march 15,"" he said. he stressed that ""status quo will be maintained at the disputed site"" and that construction on the undisputed land would not hamper entry into the disputed site. the religious leader also held meetings with representatives of the muslim personal law board and other muslim leaders. board spokesman kamaal farooqi said the seer had made a proposal for a solution which would combine ""both dialogue and a court settlement"", refusing to divulge further details. the board, farooqi said, had neither accepted nor rejected the proposal yet and would deliberate on it on march 9, after which its decision would be communicated to the shankaracharya. political observers say a compromise seems imminent and the vhp''s hard line is a last-ditch face-saving effort before it gives in on some of its demands. the shankaracharya, who had once met prime minister atal bihari vajpayee on monday night, met the latter again late on tuesday to discuss the issue. there was no official briefing on the meeting. related stories Â muslim board agrees to consider vhp proposalÂ hand over ayodhya land by june 2: vhpÂ kar sevaks violate prohibitory orders again

hubli: for state bajrang dal convenor pramod muthalik, who is whipping up hindu support in the region for construction of the ram temple in ayodhya, the stand of the bjp on the issue has turned out to be difficult to swallow. muthalik said, ``all those who are opposing temple construction, including vajpayee and advani are anti-hindu''''. he was reacting to prime minister vajpayee''s statement that the government will not allow the activists to go ahead with their plan without hearing the apex courts verdict. has the bjp deceived the sangha parivar on ayodhya issue? muthalik was evasive in his answer. he said, ``all political parties have deceived the majority hindus in the country.'''' but the bjp rode to power banking on ayodhya issue. for this, he said, political compulsions forced the bjp to fall in line with other parties, ``who are all set to appease the minorities.'''' he did not agree to a point that survival of the nda government has become more important than the construction of the ram temple. according to him, bjp national president k. janakrishna murthy has conveyed the party stand to the centre that the undisputed land should be handed over to the ram janmabhoomi nyas. he asserted that neither the court nor the prime minister could stop the bhoomi puja on march 15. he wanted all the temples in the region to perform special pooja on march 15 to coincide with the bhoomi pooja in ayodhya. muthalik said, about 1,500 activists from karnataka and 300 from hubli will participate in the pooja in ayodhya.",0,0,0,0,0
195,668,"kolkata: senior bjp leader k r malkani on sunday said there was no inaction on part of gujarat government during the recent communal flare up, and said narendra modi regime has done its utmost to control the situation. comparing the recent riots with those witnessed in the western indian state in 1969, malkani said that the then congress government could not contain the violence for 20 days. ""the modi government tried its best. if you compare the recent riots with those in 1969, you have to admit that the present dispensation in the state had fared much better,"" malkani, a former bjp vice president told newspersons on the sidelines of a convention here. likening the godhra train carnage to the chauri chaura incident in 1921 when a mob had burnt down a police station charring to death several policemen, malkani said the incident then had shocked the entire nation and prompted gandhiji to call off the non-cooperation movement. ""the godhra incident provoked the reaction among the people. however, i feel despite godhra such reaction should not have taken placed,"" he said. brushing aside allegations that the state government and the centre''s ruling coalition had delayed army deployment in the affected areas, he said, ""you cannot deploy the army with a magic wand. there are lot of procedures involved in it"". ""they had lost no time in rushing a large number of police personnel. the military was pressed into service when police failed to contain the violence,"" he said. he also hoped the ayodhya impasse would be resolved amicably. he also charged the congress government of p v narasimha rao with having created a situation which led to the demolition of the babri mosque on december 6, 1992. ""i think that they deliberately created such a situation so as to give a bad name to our party which was in power in uttar pradesh at that time,"" he said. conceding that his party had suffered in the uttar pradesh assembly polls due to the expulsion of former state chief minister kalyan singh, he said ""singh should have acted more responsively and adhered to party discipline"". asked whether it would be proper for his party to install bsp leader mayavati as chief minister, malkani said ""we should start with trust"" he, however, said he was not aware of any discussions between the two parties in this regard. earlier, addressing a convention on ''indo-centric education'', malkani, a bjp ideologue, lambasted the present education system in the country, describing it as one foisted on the people by the british masters. ""this system is sought to be continued by the so-called secular socialists"". making a strong pitch for imparting ''indian education'' to the masses, he quipped ""we are good inspite of our education system. mahatma gandhi, bal gangadhar tilak and g k gokhale would have been greater if they had indian education"". lambasting the critics of the nda governemnt''s education policy, he said there was nothing wrong with ''saffronising the education system''. ""these intellecutals who are criticising us have vested interests. their ranks are dominated by the marxists and madrasahwallahs"", he said. describing the expression ''hindu communalism'' as a contradiction in itself, he said ""a hindu can never be communal. at times some hindus do behave fanatically, but that is a reaction to a more fanatical behaviour from the other side"". further defending the nda government''s proposed changes in the education system, he said ""the history taught so far in the schools present a distorted picture of our great country. such a curriculum was introduced by the british rulers to prevent any growth of nationalistic feelings among indians"". citing the example of china, where medical students were taught chinese medicine in the final year of their course, he asked ""why can''t we have indian medicine in the curriculum of medical education in our country?"" he also flayed the vehement opposition to astrology being regarded as a science, and said ""if meteorology can be called a science, then what''s the problem with astrology? ... those who believe in astrology should be allowed to study the subject if they so wished"". calling the american society a ''ravan''s lanka which has only gold and no love or virtue"", he said ""i am afraid of the influences of american society. i strongly feel that youth below 30 should not be allowed to go to that country"" . in an interesting submission, malkani also claimed that koutilya''s arthashastra was a compulsory study in pakistani military schools.

""there are some unpublished verses, too, including those that were burnt in the 1969 riots"", zakia said. showing one of the urdu collections, kandil(lamp), a relative of jafri read out a verse which said, ""if you are a good messiah, why don''t you reveal what you are? why don''t you put off the candle that fails to provide light?"" another verse on communal violence, written in 1996, as if a premonition of what was to come six years later, read, ""neither the apostle nor the alexander came out. only daggers sprouted on busy streets. everyone said they were messiahs. but when they knocked, they were found to be tormentors. human corpses decomposed on the streets. even the crows seemed to live better than man."" with kandil in her hands, zakia said, ""those who attacked us and our neighbours must be punished by law. i am sure, justice would come one day."" zakia denied her husband had fired shots from a private gun provoking mob attack, as alleged by some. a witness to the tragic event, she does not betray feelings of despair.

203,1,"ahmedabad: the communal disturbances that rocked the city for one week has caused heavy losses of around rs 300 crore to the production and sale of fabrics manufactured in 18 textile mills and over 200 process houses and powerloom units - a majority of them still closed as fear stricken workers have left for their native places. according to a rough survey made by the ahmedabad textile mills association and the textile labour association the representative union over 1,00,000 workers employed in these units have suffered loss of wages totalling to around rs 10 crore due to the disturbances in last few days, the tla general secretary manhar shukla said. shukla, who has witnessed the worst 1969 communal riots in the city, told tnn: ""it was horrible this time because several innocent people were burnt alive by the miscreants and the labourers were the adversly affected as usual."" while recalling his trumatic experiences of 1969 the veteran gandhian trade unionist said, ""even in 1969 the labour areas of gomtipur and amraiwadi and rajpur-hirpur bore the brunt of communal orgy and the representatives of the majoor mahajan sangh had moved alongwith army personnel in the affected areas and helped restore peace and order."" he lamented that around 25 textile mills had closed down following textile crisis in eighties and now only 18 of them were functioned and out of that some units of the national textile corporation were on the verge of closure and therefore the losses to the production and wages were less as compared to that of rs 30 crore in 1969. excepting big textile units like that of arvind and ashima all other mills had to keep their shutters down as workers did not report for duty for six to seven days. even on wednesday only 30 per cent of the labourers had reached the mills. the mills he said had remained closed for 3 months following a call for ''hartal'' given by mahatma gandhi demanding more wages for the workers in forties which was considered a golden period for textile mills of ahmedabad. after that the mills had to remain closed for few days during maha gujarat movement and later on in 1973`s navnirman agitation and 1985 communal riots and also in 1992 in the wake of demolition of babri mosque. the atma and tla have issued a joint appeal for restoration of peace and have also sent a letter to the state government regarding problems of the textile mills, he added. after so many years the offices of the gandhian trade union had to remain closed following curfew in the walled city areas.

mumbai: taking a lesson from 1992 when they were caught unawares by the suddenness of the post-babri riots, citizensâ€™ organisations here are quick to react to the communal conflagration in gujarat and are determined to douse the fire before it can reach mumbai. non-governmental organisations, trade unions, mohalla committees, gandhians, civil libertarians, students bodies, nirmala niketan, tata institute of social sciences and several other bodies are holding meetings across the city and some have even started doing whatever they can to help the riot-hit in gujarat and to keep the peace in mumbai. painfully aware of the role of rumour in inciting riots, the organisations are forming a network to check out facts and relay crucial news to key functionaries. through posters, street plays and street-corner meeting, citizens are being reminded not to believe in rumours or react in panic to any situation. for instance, there were rumours of bomb blast at dhobi talao on tuesday afternoon when it was just a tyre burst outside metro theatre. activists plan to mobilise prominent citizens for the cause besides holding awareness meetings at various localities in the city. posters saying, â€œprotect your neighbour, protect your neighbourhood,â€™â€™ are being made and plans are afoot to distribute them through various trade unions. at one meeting, a proposal was made to target students with the message of communal harmony so that they could relay the message home. the activists have also decided to felicitate those citizens and police officers who saved lives in the communal riots of december 1992-january 1993. among the several meetings organised is a seminar by lokraj sanghatana on â€˜how to stop communal violenceâ€™ at 7 p.m. on march 15 at the bhupesh gupta bhavan, prabhadevi. a fund collection drive for gujarat victims and methods to reach aid to them were also discussed. many activists were of the view that it was best to send cash to voluntary agencies involved in relief work in gujarat as there was a possibility of aid being intercepted and looted. several activists have rushed to gujarat to get a first-hand assessment of the riot situation and to set up base for relief workers who are to follow.volunteers were also sought to reach out to the traumatised riots victims, many of whom were still hiding in forests and fields.a team of 50 doctors left for gujarat on monday. the larger issues also are being debated. for instance, some activists are against demanding a ban on the vishwa hindu parishad and the bajrang dal as that would only push them underground. the peopleâ€™s union for civil liberties also opposed demands for giving full powers to the army. on tuesday evening, nearly 400 activists from various organisations congregated at hutatma chowk to condemn the killings at godhra and the carnage in gujarat. â€œwe condemn the cycle of attack and retaliation in the strongest possible terms and deplore the fact that true religion is being subverted to serve narrow political ends,â€™â€™ said a pamphlet distributed on the occasion.",0,0,1,0,0

mumbai: stevedoring in mumbai has almost come to an end with just ten firms still holding licences while the others have surrendered their right to supervise loading and unloading of vessels because it has become unremunerative.

stevedoring firms supervise loading and unloading of cargo in vessels. for over 200 years, they formed the backbone of the ports and shipping industry because they could delay loading and unloading of vessels, forcing a ship owner into penury. ship owners would lose crores of rupees within weeks because the ship had to continue to remain berthed with wharfage, cranage and other costs going up.

but from earning crores of rupees each month, today these stevedores collectively owe the mumbai port trust (mbpt) about rs 20 crore by way of workers'' wages which they are unable to pay because their earnings have dipped with the falling container traffic in this port, according to mbpt sources.

twenty-one firms were once members of the bombay stevedores association (bsa) which was set up in september 1953. but after the jawaharlal nehru port trust (jnpt) was set up on may 1, 1989, huge container vessels had to go there because the centuries-old mbpt did not have enough water depth to allow huge container vessels to berth.

so from handling 600,000 containers each year, the mbpt container traffic dwindled to just about 250,000 containers per year while the occupancy rate of its 24 berths also fell to less than 50 per cent, according to bsa president resham singh.

each stevedoring firm had to fork out about rs 12 lakhs per month because they had to pay the workers their wages. the union insisted on the stevedores using the surplus labour in the mbpt consisting of eight persons per gang although the firms had no money to pay them. also, global shipping lines such as maersk preferred to use ports such as kandla or even the minor ports such as pipav, dahej and porbandar in gujarat, where the cost of loading and unloading was much cheaper.

the indiscriminate allotment of licences by the mbpt to combat the monopoly of the stevedores who earlier did not allow new entrants into their cartel also speeded up the death of the industry. the stevedores challenged this in the bombay high court where they lost. they went to the supreme court which observed that it was left to the chairman of the mbpt to use his discretion.",0,0,0,0,0

""the rashtrapati bhawan belongs to you, so is the acquired land,"" justice g b pattanaik said with a view to stress the fact that once status quo was ordered and the government was made the absolute owner of the acquired land, nothing temporary or symbolic could be allowed on it. ""this is not rashtrapati bhawan,"" sorabjee replied back and continued to offer the centre's stand on the proposed bhoomi pujan. at the outset, three senior most judges - justice b n kirpal, justice g b pattanaik and justice v n khare who will become chief justice in 2002 - asked the centre if it stood by the undertaking given to the court earlier. the bench was referring to demolition of babri mosque in 1992 despite an undertaking given by the centre and the up government that it would be protected at all costs. when sorabjee replied, ""the object is not to rake up the past"", the bench shot back: ""we cannot forget the past. we do not want to repeat the past"", referring the vhp's promise broken on december 6, 1992. sorabjee explained that the centre sought to give this concession (allowing bhoomi pujan) because of strong emotions expressed by the majority community. the court was not impressed. ""if you (centre) allow puja today, will you allow 'namaz' there tomorrow?"" the court asked. equally sharp were the court's queries over the legal status of the vhp, respondent in bhure's petition. ""what is vhp? is it a trust or a society under the societies act and is it registered?"" the judges asked vhp's counsel rama jois, former chief justice of the karnataka and punjab and haryana high courts. counsel was not sure about it. he said it was not the vhp but ram janmabhoomi nyas that had sought permission to perform the puja. later, jois said the vhp was a registered body, but he could not inform the court about its aims and objects. he said all the trustees of 'nyas' who started the movement 40 years ago are over 75 years of age and they want to ""breathe their last"" after performing a small bhoomi pujan for lord ram's temple. when jois pleaded for permission to perform the puja, the bench said it might escalate the situation. but jois said by not allowing the puja, the court might escalate the situation as lakhs of people wanted a temple in ayodhya. ""but lakhs also do not want construction of the temple"", the bench retorted. as jois said eight years had elapsed since the suits over ownership of the acquired land were reopened but only 23 witnesses had been examined, the bench said it was because of the litigating parties that the hearings had been adjourned.

ahmedabad: at 4.30 pm on tuesday, gujarat chief minister narendra modi was supposed to pass the sensitive dilli darwaja area. he was not there till 6.15 pm. six days after the carnage, modi had suddenly decided to tour the riot-hit areas of cg road jamalpur, kalupur, chamanpura and naroda patia. the atmosphere at dilli chakla area was tense with agitated activity. a crowd followed the food and civil supplies minister bharat barot who walked cautiously looking over his shoulder along the dudheshwar side of the gate in his own constituency of dariapur. a group from the minority community watched from the across the road.word had got around that modi''s convoy was arriving. modi reached chamanpura around 6.45 pm escorted by police commissioner pc pande with energy minister kaushik patel, education minister anandi patel, and naroda legislator maya kodnani. the local bjp corporators had arrived with groups of people slowly building at the entrance of the gulbarg society where former mp ehsan jaffri was burnt to death in his home. the place wore an eerie and charred look. former deputy mayor jagrupsinh rajput who stays nearby, too waited for the elite visit. modi got off his car. a local resident got emotional and shouted, ""bhajap ki sarkar ek mp ko nahin bacha saki"". he would have continued but for modi''s retort â€” ""bhashan karne ki zarurat nahin hai"". the worried policemen huddled closer as modi and his ministers walked into the society and stood right outside the remains of jaffri''s house. joint commissioner of police (sector ii) mk tandon briefed him about what happened as modi nodded. the mention of a madrassa caught his attention. ""kahan tha madrassa?"", modi asked. tandon pointed at the site. ""kitne bachhe the?"" there was some estimated figure quoted. ""aur yahan ka maulvi...?"" quizzed modi. everyone drew a nervous blank. tandon continued with the sequence of events and how the police moved some 150 persons out of the society to safer places. this interested modi. ""where are they? â€” if the police has done good work, why don''t you tell people about it? â€” this is what will build confidence"" â€” came the fusillade from the cm. not a word about the 42 persons who had died here. on his return he looked carefully at the building from where some persons had fired from their private weapons on thursday last, at the mob. that was the end of the chamanpura tour. modi got into the front seat of his car amid slogans of ""bharat mata ki jai"" and waved as the crowd clapped and cheered. modi''s convoy drove into naroda patia where the charred remains of the houses and the mosque where 65 persons had been burnt alive stood mute testimony. some thousands waited for him and shouted ""bharat mata ki jai"", ""narendra modi zindabad"". modi did not even bother to cross the road to take a look at the scene of crime. he stepped off the car, returned the cheers of his supporters as they clapped as if in celebration. there was no sign of remorse. ""he doesn''t even have the guts to meet people, only talks to policemen,"" mumbled an anguished resident of naroda. but there were many to counter. ""he who stands amid the people wins their heart â€” what a man!"" â€” remarked another, in admiration of the man who called for all this attention at this graveyard. exactly five minutes was what the chief minister gave to the memory of the 65 dead here as the convoy drove away at 7.15 pm.

220,75,"lucknow: with samajwadi partyâ€™s mulayam singh yadav staking his claim to form the next government in up, and his immediate rivals, the bjp and the bsp, bowing out of the race for the time being, governor vishnukant shastri seems to have been left with no excuse to avoid taking a decision. he has two options before him: seek imposition of presidentâ€™s rule or give mulayam a chance. and he has to take a decision soon. in fact, shastri began the process by meeting bjp leader and outgoing chief minister rajnath singh on thursday. rajanth reiterated his partyâ€™s decision to sit in the opposition and handed over a letter to this effect to the governor. interestingly, rajnath denied any possibility of a bjp-bsp alliance at this juncture by saying: â€˜â€˜it is time for the holi festivities and not raksha bandhan, which is six months away.â€™â€™ the bsp too has apprised the governor about its decision not to support any political party in government formation. a letter to this effect was handed over to the governor on thursday on behalf of mayawati, who is away in delhi along with her party mlas. parrying queries, shastri said: â€˜â€˜i am keen to take a quick decision.â€™â€™ but for this, he said he would have to talk to leaders of all political parties and seek their views in writing. â€˜â€˜the process has begun with a meeting with rajnath,â€™â€™ he said, adding that after completing this exercise, another round of talks would be held with mulayam before taking a final decision on government formation. although the term of the current assembly will expire on march 26, the governor seems to be under compulsion to hasten his decision. it is mainly because of the bjpâ€™s predicament, which stands a chance of getting isolated from its nda partners at the centre in the wake of a possible confrontation with the vhp on ayodhya. this is coupled with the administrative mess in up due to the absence of any government at present. any delay on the part of the governor may spell doom for an already anaemic bjp in up. but either way, the governorâ€™s delay cannot bail out the bjp. if mulayam is given a chance, he may form the government, but if the state is put under presidentâ€™s rule, then the governor will himself rake up the same controversy that engulfed his predecessor, romesh bhandari.

ahmedabad: the communal flare-up in gujarat just refuses to die down. though reports of killings subsided, there was no respite from rioters and arsonists who took to the streets in several areas, including surat, bhavnagar and ahmedabad on sunday. police opened fire on mobs setting fire to property and looting goods in bhavnagar and surat. even though no new killings were reported on sunday, the toll in the communal violence has climbed sharply to 430, according to the state police control room in gandhinagar. this is because many bodies were recovered from towns and cities rocked by the violence over the last five days. the official figure is expected to be revised to 470 by monday morning. new areas were engulfed in violence. morbi in rajkot district had to be brought under curfew following incidents of arson and looting. mobs set fire to shops and trucks on the highway in the ranika area of bhavnagar, which continued to remain tense throughout the day. four companies of paramilitary forces have been rushed to bhavnagar. in ahmedabad, mobs set on fire a scrap-yard and two other business establishments in the karanj area of the walled city from which at least nine persons were rescued. in surat, the three columns of the army which arrived on sunday morning, helped to arrest the fast deteriorating situation within the city but violence erupted in the outskirts of the city, particularly in pandesara, limabayat and at the causeway near rander. to disperse the mob at several places, the police fired over 50 rounds and over 100 persons were arrested in combing operations in the city, police commissioner v k gupta said. earlier, the situation in surat worsened when an estimated 2000-strong mob gathered near the gujarat housing board society at pani ki tanki in pandesara in the morning and burnt down several shops. police had a lot of difficulty in reaching the troubled spot as the roads were blocked with logs and bricks. they opened fire and lobbed tear-gas shells to disperse the mob. no casualties were reported till late in the evening. there was also a communal clash in deodhar near palanpur, where four persons were burnt alive and two killed in police firing. the official toll in the communal violence since wednesday has actually gone up to 488 if one takes into account the 58 persons killed in the sabarmati express attack. there were reports of overnight clashes in surat and the state police control room put the toll in the district at 16, including the six people killed in police firing. however, the surat police put the toll at five. curfew continued in the sensitive areas like bardoli as a precautionary measure, said sp (surat rural) kln rao. incidents of looting and arson and razing of a mosque were reported from ambaji, danta and harad areas of sabarkantha, said sources. according to figures in the state police control room, 73 have been killed in firing by the police, army and paramilitary forces. as many as 613 people have been seriously injured in the clashes and hospitalised. most of the deaths have taken place in ahmedabad where the toll is now being officially quoted at 233, including 30 killed in police firing. curfew was relaxed for women and children for six hours. police officials said nearly 2,537 people have so far been rounded up in the state. meanwhile, in godhra the police arrested two persons, one of who is the president of the godhra municipality, on sunday. the arrests followed immediately after the visit of union home minister lk advani. godhra municipality president mohammad husain abdul rahim kalota (47) was picked up by the police in connection with wednesday''s train carnage along with shiraz abdullah jamesha (52), who is a transporter, anti-terrorist squad dig vipul vijoy singh told tnn on sunday. workers of the vishwa hindu parishad and the bharatiya janata party have been booked for murder in firs filed in connection with the naroda-patia massacre of friday. sixty-five people were killed in the incident. interestingly, the firs filed at the meghaninagar police station names kishan korani, pj rajput, harish rohera, babu bajrangi and raju chaubal apart from 10-15,000 people, in the complaint filed by police sub-inspector ak solanki.",1,1,1,0,1

227,128,"new delhi: secularism, a basic feature of the constitution, guarantees right to life and liberty to every citizen. as this tenet professes respect for every religion, the state is under a constitutional obligation to protect the life and property of anyone, irrespective of his caste, colour or creed.

therefore, failure in carrying out this duty may be construed as failure of the constitutional machinery in a given state, irrespective of the ruling party''s political philosophy. in other words, the philosophy must be in line with the preamble of the constitution.

the applicability of the principle comes into focus in the backdrop of communal backlash in gujarat. deaths due to communal violence are on the rise. whether the state was caught unawares or failed to act in time can only be decided through a time-consuming exercise called the judicial commission under the commissions of inquiry act.

the eventual fate of the commission''s findings is anybody''s guess, considering that the findings of several fact-finding commissions set up by the centre or any state remain only on paper. so, no wonder if the panel''s findings on the gujarat mayhem may meet the same fate as that of the sri krishna commission report on the mumbai riots. the indicted government had ``rubbished'''' the report while its successor is still scrutinising the report to take action against the guilty.

lawyers such as r k jain, v n saraf and a former attorney general said that the commissions of inquiry act must be amended, making it mandatory to take action on the findings of a commission. ``otherwise, the commissions will remain a farce,'''' said jain. saraf too regretted: ``the findings adorn the heavily dusted shelves of the government.''''

the former attorney general, too, said ``the commissions are set up as an alibi by the government''''.

commenting on the riots, in a rare judgment, the apex court has observed ``the leaders and the society have not played their part to teach them (rioters) that religions are not meant for killing fellow human beings. if ignorance had prompted people to take cudgels in the name of religion for indulging in carnage or murders, they are no doubt liable to be convicted and sentenced for the offence committed by them.''''

mumbai: the all-india christian council (aicc) has called for an international ban on the vishwa hindu parishad (vhp) and the bajrang dal. it has also decided to move the united nations high commissioner on human rights and other international forums to investigate the activities and the funding sources of these organisations in the western countries as well as in west asia, japan and mauritius.

aicc secretary-general john dayal condemned the violence and destruction caused by religious extremists in gujarat and said a ban on these fundamentalist organisations in india was not enough as their evil ideology had found supporters in other parts of the world as well. ``the indian government banned the students islamic movement of india (simi), however it has taken no action against these hindu extremists despite overwhelming evidence of complicity in violence against christians and muslims,'''' he said.

according to him, these organisations have engaged in constant hate campaigns against the minorities and have also recruited thousands of people for arms training. he cited the march 2 incidents of violence against christian missionaries in gujarat as a part of these campaigns. he stated that huge funds were used for these campaigns. ``the vhp''s devious campaign to gain respectability in the un and other forums have been fully exposed by its present actions and statements,'''' he said.

the council has also called upon the supreme court and the national human rights commission to investigate the government and police complicity in the communal carnage. mr dayal condemned the gujarat government and said it had made the state the laboratory for hindutva experiment. he said the council had on many other occasions pointed out that the police and bureaucracy in the state had been infiltrated by the hindutva ideology which traced its roots to hitler''s nazism, but to no avail.

ahmedabad/gandhinagar: is the time ripe for the bjp in gujarat to dissolve the assembly and hold early elections? speculation is rife in political circles that with the voters once again polarised along communal lines and the growing pressure for chief minister narendra modi to resign, the latter may seek the bjp central leadership''s permission to dissolve the assembly rather than just sacrifice the cm''s post. the assembly''s natural life comes to an end in march 2003, which means election would have to be held around january next year. so far it looks like a lost case for the bjp which has been successively losing elections at the panchayat and municipal level, showing its dropping popularity graph. sources close to modi say pressure for the cm''s resignation is likely to grow in the coming week with parliament poised to discuss the gujarat situation and the possibility of some nda allies joining the chorus. according to an official close to the cm, ""modi is very upset with the intense criticism in the media in recent days, but he may turn this into his advantage by saying he is now going back to the people to seek their mandate once again."" state congress president amarsinh choudhary said: ""i have also heard the rumours that the bjp is keen on playing the hindu card, but it will be foolishness because the bjp will only land up losing the opportunity to rule for a few more months."" there was no need for this ''foolishness'', he said, because the congress would come back to power whenever elections are held next in the state. the hardliners in the bjp, however, feel that it would not be able to come back to power on the basis of its performance if the assembly lasted its full term. even in the last three assembly byelections, the bjp could win only rajkot-2 because the cm himself was the candidate. keshubhai was replaced last october only because he could not arrest the downslide of the bjp, culminating in the humiliating defeat in the sabarmati and sabarkantha elections. a section of the bjp has even put out inflated figures like ""winning up to 150 seats"" out of a total of 182 in the assembly polls, if polls are held immediately. the next trial of strength between the congress and the bjp will be in the 70-odd municipality elections which are due on march 31 but these have now been postponed to mid-april. the bjp might like to gauge the mood of the electorate in these elections before taking a decision on holding assembly polls. but the liberals in the bjp are clearly jittery. ministers and mlas belonging to the suresh mehta camp strongly hold the view that post-riots, the bjp might be in for a ""big trouble"". inquiry commissions, judicial and non-judicial, might try to find evidence of the bjp and vhp leaders'' direct or indirect involvement in the riots which would put the party on the defensive at a time it is trying to distance itself from the ayodhya imbroglio. ""firs are already being filed against some bjp leaders. hostile police officials and bureaucrats will proceed on with vengeance. we are in for big trouble,"" said a liberal leader, who is also apprehensive that many liberals might be denied the ticket in this surcharged atmosphere and some more hardliners might be drafted into electoral politics. leader of opposition in the state assembly naresh raval said there might be a ""temporary gain to the bjp"".",0,0,1,0,0

lucknow: even as the vhp is in double mind whether to go ahead with its march 15 programme or scale down following pressure from all corners, the state administration is on its toes to deal with any eventuality. for reviewing the situation in ayodhya, the state government held a high-level meeting on monday. ""we have already made elaborate security arrangements. security will be tightened further in and around ayodhya to thwart attempt by anyone to violate status quo order by the supreme court,"" said dr anil kumar gupta, commissioner, faizabad division. barricading around the disputed ram janambhoomi complex will be doubled up soon. even though no restriction have been put on â€˜darshanâ€™ of ram lala at the makeshift temple, the area may be cordoned off in case of any threat. in a bid to prevent vhp from taking carved pillars from its two workshops, the administration has already sealed the main gates so that no trucks, tractors or any other mode are allowed to ferry stones to the disputed site on march 15. the directions from the ministry of home affairs are loud and clear â€” no way ramsevaks should be allowed to reach near the rjb complex. so far the administration was little lenient in dealing with ramsevaks, but a statewide crackdown against them is likely from tuesday onwards. ""anyone trying to break the security cordon or violating the prohibitory orders would be arrested,"" said a senior police official. the administrationâ€™s strategy is to cut the vhp supply line, both manpower as well ration, so no build-up is made by march 15. restriction on vehicular traffic and diversion of rails have not only affected influx of ramsevaks but also supply of ration. ""two of our trucks carrying rations are stranded on borders. despite our repeated request, they are not being allowed entry into ayodhya,"" rued purshottam narain singh, vhp state president. for vhp, itâ€™s make-or-break situation. caught between devil and deep sea, the noise of defiance coming from top leadership is mainly for pacifying their cadre which is getting extremely unnerved by its changing stance on the temple construction. vn arora adds from ayodhya: chanting jai shree ram, about 350 ayodhya residents on monday defied prohibitory orders and took out a protest march venting their grouse against restrictions posed by the district administration on ramsevaks. later, they participated in the ongoing purna ahuti yajna. significantly, six members of a muslim family abdul rehman also participated in the protest march and purna ahuti yajna. slogan-shouting continued for over an hour but it went unnoticed and the administration has decided to step up security in and around ramsevakpuram and karsevakpuram from tuesday to restrict movements of ramsevaks. ""its violation of our religious rights. we are denied permission to pay obeisance and peacefully participate in our religious programmes,"" charged lallu singh, bjp mla from ayodhya. meanwhile, despite ban, a number of ramsevaks from madhya pradesh and maharashtra have sneaked into ayodhya. vhp media incharge sharad sharma claimed that about 1,000 ramsevaks are already camping in ramsevakpuram and about a a lakh are expected to reach by march 15.

ahmedabad: bjp national president jana krishnamurthy on monday said the train carnage at godhra was a part of sinister designs of those elements who were in a tight position following effective action against terrorism not only in jammu and kashmir but also in other parts of the world. while addressing a news conference here, krishnamurthy said that the riots in ahmedabad and other parts of the state was a fall-out of what had happened in the sabarmati express train. he said communal violence in any form has to be condemned, as no society can progress with such kind of hatred and violence. society should come forward to restore order and at the same time remain vigilant that such ugly incidents are not repeated. the bjp has decided to observe march 9 as ""antrik aatankvadi virodhi diwas"". on that day, party leaders and union ministers will visit various parts of the country and explain people about the designs of subversive elements, responsible for the godhra train tragedy. lashing out at congress allegation about delay in calling out the army to quell riots in the state, the bjp leader said that ""the responsible leaders of the congress should not forget that in 1984 riots in new delhi, the army was not called till the worst was over in the first 48 hours there"". however, within few hours of the incidents in ahmedabad, the prime minister had called union defence minister george fernandes, who rushed here and arranged for the deployment of army to curb the violence. the centre, he said, had already alerted the state governments regarding possible reactions of the incidents in gujarat. the situation is now returning to normalcy and it was time for all peace loving people to come forward and extend support to the authorities in establishing peace and order. the bjp workers will also join in relief and rehabilitation task in the coming days, he added.",0,0,1,1,0

mumbai: if reactions from a cross-section of the cityâ€™s consumer and political activists are any indication, finance minister yeshwant sinha has managed to come up with a budget that â€œuniformly dissatisfies every sectorâ€™â€™. although expectations were low this year, activists said the present budget was an especially unimaginative one, which taxes the working class yet does not inject any vigour into industry. â€œi would only give four marks out of ten to this budget,â€™â€™ said n.g. wagle of the consumer guidance society of india. â€œmr sinha has halved investment benefits under section 88 for those in the rs 1.5 to rs 5 lakh annual income slab on the presumption that this is the upper income group. but doesnâ€™t he know that to run a normal household these days requires a monthly minimum income of rs 10,000 ?â€™â€™ mr wagle asked. the removal of subsidy on lpg and kerosene has also affected people across the board. activists said it was ridiculous that on the one hand, the price of an lpg cylinder had been hiked by rs 40, while on the other, petrol had become cheaper by just re 1 per litre. â€œa rs 40 hike on a cylinder is no small thing. it will affect almost every household,â€™â€™ noted sanjeev kanchan of the citizensâ€™ organisation for public opinion. others pointed out that even the small reprieve in petrol prices would only benefit vehicle owners. â€œwhichever way you look at it, the burden on the ordinary citizen has only multiplied,â€™â€™ noted activists. mr wagle was also critical of the surcharge on income tax. he claimed such surcharges had become a routine feature of the taxing system and were not the way to generate more revenue. â€œfirst you have a kargil surcharge, then a gujarat one, and now a security one. surcharges are fine as a one-off thing, but they shouldnâ€™t become a routine feature,â€™â€™ he noted. critical of the slash in investment rates, shirish deshpande of the mumbai grahak panchayat said that senior citizens, many of whom were solely dependent on savings for their monthly income, would be badly hit. mr deshpande also added that the budget proposals, more than anything else, proved that the budget had not been drafted by the finance minister of a sovereign nation, but under the dictates of the world trade organisation (wto). he noted that mr sinha had admitted that imported liquor would become cheaper because of the wto agreement, although he refused to make that admission for the other provisions. â€œthe writing on the wall is clear.â€™â€™ state secretary of the cpi (m) prabhakar sanzgiri agreed. â€œmany of the provisions are well in line with the move to globalise and liberalise the economy. but as the past decade has shown, this has not translated into a better life for the working classes.the burden of tax has fallen on their shoulders, directly as well as through the hidden charges in several services.â€™â€™ mr sanzgiri noted that a half per cent cut in interest rates on savings would hit individuals in a big way. but at the same time, the budget did not really provide much for industries on the verge of closure. â€œall the concessions are for foreign investments, not domestic ones,â€™â€™ mr sanzgiri said. chief of the city congress unit murli deora said, â€œthe stock market reaction to the budget is a good yardstick. the way the market has dipped is a clear indication that the budget is anti-investor.this budget is so directionless, so unimaginative, that i feel there is nothing even to comment upon.â€™â€™ â€œwhere are the allocations for providing drinking water and electricity connections for the lakhs of people who are denied these basics?â€™â€™ demanded veteran political activist ahilya rangnekar. â€œthis is such a disappointing budget,â€™â€™ she noted. commenting on the schemes for providing foodgraims to adolescent girls as well as pregnant and nursing mothers, ms rangnekar said that unfortunately, most of these schemes tended to remain only on paper. however, there were a few aspects of the budget which were well-received. the proposal to double the rates of competition postcards to rs 10 was one.â€œthis is a very good move. it will generate much revenue and also discourage this growing trend for easy gains,â€™â€™ said mr deshpande. he also welcomed the increase in the price of soft drinks which, he said, were not salutary for oneâ€™s health.",0,0,0,0,0

mumbai: the nation is eagerly awaiting the supreme court verdict on wednesday when it is expected to pronounce whether or not the vishwa hindu parishad (vhp) and other hindutva organisations would be allowed to do the controversial bhoomi pujan at the disputed site in ayodhya. the all india muslim personal law board (aimplb), which has emerged as the principal negotiator with the government on the ayodhya issue, has declared that it will abide by the courtâ€™s order. however, the vhp has refrained from issuing any such statement. in this context, this newspaper spoke to islamic scholar asghar ali engineer. excerpts: do you agree with the aimplbâ€™s assurance regarding the courtâ€™s order? although i support this stand, i am concerned how such an assurance was given when the vhp refused to commit anything. even today, the vhp refuses to say that it will honour the apex courtâ€™s order on the issue of â€˜bhoomi pujanâ€™ on march 15. in the absence of a clear commitment by the vhp, how do you react to the communally charged situation today, specially in the backdrop of godhra? the vhp is whipping up communal passions in the country. kar sevaks are reaching ayodhya though prohibitory orders have been issued there. the centre still does not seem to be taking enough steps to check the entry of kar sevaks into ayodhya. itâ€™s time the supreme court took suo motu notice of the prevailing situation and issued specific directions to the centre. but prime minister a.b. vajpayee says he has been consulting muslim leadership for a long time now. the same mr vajpayee has not even bothered to constitute the national integration council ever since the government came to power. even mohalla committees meet in such times; here the nic has not even been set up when the nation is being put to a communal test once again. you had initially opposed the role of the aimplb as a negotiator in the ayodhya dispute. please comment. it was not my personal opinion. it was decided by a group of prominent secular citizens that any negotiations on the ayodhya issue should be held with the government and not with the vhp, to which the aimplb agreed. besides, it is not an elected body representing muslims. like the aimplb, the vhp also is not an elected body of the hindus, but it is spearheading the temple movement.how does one assess the feelings of a common hindu or a muslim? the bjp came to power on the ram temple issue. however, in the recent assembly elections in uttar pradesh, the same issue could not get them enough seats. in fact, the ayodhya issue today seems to be threatening the bjpled government at the centre. this should be some indication of the feelings of the majority community to the temple issue now. but do you feel the common muslim is against the construction of the ram temple at the disputed site? i donâ€™t think so. had that been the case, the aimplb, which has representatives even from the babri masjid action committee and the babri masjid action coordination committee would not have agreed to abide by the supreme courtâ€™s orders. after all, if the court rules in favour of a temple, it will have to be built on the disputed site. do you think we are nearing a solution to the ayodhya controversy? i am not sure.the vhp has always gone back on its promise. muslims as a community cannot trust it. muslims do not trust the bjp-led government either, but since they are in power, one has to take their word. but the vhp should give written assurance to the court that it will not rake up the issues of kashi or mathura. the bjp as a party has always blamed the lack of leadership and direction among the countryâ€™s muslims for not allowing the community to enter the national mainstream. the only grievance of muslims is that whichever party they thought was secular merely used them as a vote-bank. only six per cent of our mps belong to the muslim community. the representation in the assemblies is even lower. muslims are not allowed to become leaders in major political parties.the moment they form a political party, they are branded as communal.

286,258,"new delhi: the vajpayee government is building a case for handing over to the ramjanambhoomi nyas at least part â€” if not the entire â€” 67 acres of land in the immediate vicinity of the demolished babri masjid acquired by the centre in december 1992. highly placed sources in the government say that if the acquired land is divided into ""essential"" land â€” needed to maintain the security of the disputed 40x80 feet on which the mosque stood as well as access to it â€” and ""superfluous, excess"" land beyond it, ""there should be no objection"" to handing over the latter to the vhp. not just that, the sources maintain there are provisions in sections 6 and 7 of the acquisition of certain area at ayodhya act, 1993, which entitle the centre to hand over the land to the rjn. the reason why the vhp''s demand is being given such serious consideration is not merely the organisation''s capacity for trouble, but a growing sense in the ranks of the bjp leadership â€” after the party''s abysmal performance in the recent assembly elections â€” that only the revival of the hindutva card can infuse a fresh life into a moribund organisation. at the same time, a section in the government feels that, given the current ""surcharged atmosphere"" in gujarat and elsewhere in the country, this is not the right time to hand over the land, for which the vhp has now announced a fresh deadline of june 2. but the question is: if handing over part or all of the acquired land to the rjn was so simple, why has it not been done thus far? official sources say there are three options on handing over of the land. the first is handing over the ""superfluous"" land as that would still ensure the security and access to the disputed spot. but in 1994, the supreme court, in its advisory opinion on the validity of the acquisition act, had said that not just the fate but the extent of the ""superfluous"" land could only be determined after the title suit for the disputed spot was decided. next comes section 6, which is also being invoked as an option and which, incidentally is the one generally touted by the vhp: that the land can be given to any trust created after 1993, provided it adheres to conditions imposed on it by the government. but the rjn was created well before 1993, and it would be a travesty to hand it over to it even if it floated a fresh trust. not just that, the supreme court had pointed out in 1994 that extra land had been acquired by the centre so that in case the title suit was eventually won by the muslims, ""their success should not be thwarted by denial of proper access to enjoyment of rights in the disputed area by exercise of rights of ownership of hindu owners of the adjacent properties"". and finally section 7, which says that the acquired land can be managed either by the centre or a person/ body of persons/ trust so long as there is no change to the land till the title suit is decided. in short, if the centre invokes section 7 to give the land to the rjn, no construction can begin anyway. related storiesÂ hand over ayodhya land by june 2: vhpÂ shankaracharya meets pmÂ up govt determined not to allow build-up of kar sevaksÂ babri masjid panel threatens to move scÂ security to be tightened further in ayodhya

""things are moving not only faster but also in such unexpected directions that we are finding it difficult to keep a track of the developments, leave alone forsee what is to come,"" admitted a senior official of the intelligence department. intelligence sources said that while the visit of singhal to ayodhya has come as a whiff of fresh air to the otherwise dampening enthusiasm of the rambhakts, it is not well-received by several quarters.

kolkata: at least 15 per cent of the people affected by the gujarat earthquake are suffering from long-term mental health morbidity and need specialised psychiatric treatment. this was stated in a report prepared jointly by indian council of medical research (icmr) and institute of human behaviour & allied sciences (ihbas). released recently by union health minister c.p. thakur, the report claimed that about 30 to 50 per cent people are suffering from moderate to severe psychological disturbances. the report is based on the experience and observations of a team of doctors, headed by dr nimesh desai of ihbas, who attended the quake victims. according to the study, effort should be concentrated on indirect relief measures like employment generation. â€œpsychological recovery has been linked to micro and macro economics as well as the rehabilitation and reconstruction programmes. many communities and their leaders favour indirect relief measures like employment generation scheme over the direct assistance schemes for food or housing for the social and mental health of the affected population,â€� the report claimed. health care providers should have been more sensitive to the psychiatric needs of the people, said the report. it observed, â€œexcept for a few individuals or teams, there was barely any effort on the part of healthcare providers. so, a sensitisation and training is needed.â€� while praising the media for their role in helping mobilising national and international support, the report claimed that many of the victims suffered from shock after seeing images in the audio-visual media. men and women suffered equally from the trauma. the report warned against unskilled or untrained psychological counselling. â€œtraining for relief and rescue workers, who made spontaneous and intuitive efforts to assist the population in dealing with psychological disturbancesâ€� are to be encouraged. there is a need to focus on the emotional and psychological experience of relief workers as well as healthcare providers, including support groups. as a remedial measure, the study urged the gujarat government and other national and international agencies to prepare a long-term plan to combine service delivery and service research aspects.",0,0,0,0,0

308,218,"new delhi: the vajpayee government breathed a sigh of relief on thursday as vhp leader ashok singhal, in his capacity as managing trustee of the ramjanambhoomi nyas, gave a commitment to abide by the court verdict in the ayodhya case, even as the kanchi shankaracharya declared that the government would deal only with the rjn, and the vhp should stay out. this has now re-opened the possibility of the government permitting the bhoomi puja in ayodhya on march 15 — on which a final decision is yet to be taken. however, government sources stressed that it had been made clear to the rjn that the bhoomi puja, if permitted, would have to be a symbolic affair. it would have to be ""scaled down, with no bringing in of building material or carved pillars, and no concentration of kar sevaks"". further, restrictions on kar sevaks entering ayodhya could only be lifted once the vhp agreed that they would not come there. but it is not clear whether singhal was speaking in his individual capacity with rjn chief ramchandra paramhans — who had written to the pm on march 5 only promising status quo till the court verdict — remaining incommunicado and other vhp leaders silent. for the pm personally, this crisis has another dimension: several young bjp ministers told the home minister recently that if the government did not accede to the vhp demands, there was not much sense in carrying on with this government. as one minister put it, "" the bjp leadership has lost all credibility with its cadres, and has to do something to end that alienation first."" at the same time, the nda allies, barring the shiv sena, want to know the implications of singhal's statement.

""it was not preplanned. it was a sudden, provocative incident"", he said. the report in the washington post says ""provocation by the activists in the form of sustained hooliganism preceded retaliation. there were several prior incidents of misconduct but perhaps the spark was lit by the refusal of some activists to pay to the platform vendors for their tea."" ""for two days, as the sabarmati express snaked across northern india, some activists in cars s-5 and s-6 carried on like hooligans. they exposed themselves to other passengers. they pulled head scarves off women. they evicted a family of four in the middle of the night for refusing to join in chants. they failed to pay for tea and snacks they consumed at each stop,"" says the report. thus the reputation of the rowdiest passengers had travelled before the train which was late by several hours largely because of the activists'' behaviour. according to an intelligence official here, ""unlike the december attack on the indian parliament or the attack on the american center in kolkata where the involvement of outside agencies was proved beyond doubt, there is no concrete evidence as yet to link the gujarat carnage to `outside forces.'' "" this obviously hints towards a complete failure of the establishment in gujarat to control the situation. home minister l k advani, minister of state i d swamy, the bjp as well as the ministry of extenal affairs spokesperson have in various forums talked of the role of the isi and the underworld dons in the riots in gujarat as well as the attack on the sabarmati express. minister of state omar abdullah quickly withdrew his statement that the riots were due to `local factors'' and issued a clarification that his utterances were in a personal and not official capacity. there were reports from kolkata that some terrorists linked to the gujarat carnage had been arrested, but the reports were quickly denied by the government.

both the union and state governments have been criticised for reacting late in inducting the army into the violence-hit state. by the time the cabinet committee on security, which asked the army to be on ``stand-by'''', met on thursday evening, gujarat was already up in flames.

apart from the delay in requisitioning the army, the state government too did not reportedly provide sufficient logistical support to the army in time. consequently, the army could be deployed in ahmedabad and other towns only more than 50 hours had elapsed after the godhra train incident last wednesday morning.

according to sources, fernandes was unhappy with the way the situation has been handled by the narendra modi ministry and felt the state government was not co-operative with the army.

mallika sarabhai, a thinking dancer, a creative experimentalist and an activist is in kolkata for a private performance of schubertâ€™s shakuntala. a prolific bharatnatyam and kuchipudi dancer, mallika is associated with the dance institute darpana academy which is also a centre for non-violence. she speaks to nuzhat aziz about her institute, creative dance and the message she wants to deliver to her audience, her forthcoming films and on mallika as a person. you are a bharatnatyam and kuchipudi dancer. how has the classical dance form changed over the years? i am grateful that i have been brought up in a liberal family. my mother taught me that there was no stronger line of communication than art. i strongly feel that we cannot remain custodial to traditional things. my performance cannot be restricted to pleading in front of lord krishna when there are so many burning issues around us. we have to change. my use of bharatnatyam and kuchipudi, my use of theatre and storytelling is to get the issue and the idea across. besides being a dancer, you are also an activist. do you feel it is easier to relate to problems and issues as an activist? i am a communicator and i use different languages to communicate with people. i deal with problems which are related to human lives. i use my art form to understand why the common people are easily manipulated and the invalidity of the fear growing in them. i use dance to communicate to them. i challenge my audiences to sit up and think and realign themselves to the burning issues around them. it is the same as an activist â€” the only difference is that i use a different language. darpana academy is also an institute for development and centre for non-violence. tell us something about the work done in the institute. the centre works with schools, ngos and government bodies to create performances and creative projects dealing with social issues. for example, we organise workshops in schools where we try and make students understand the nature of violence. we ask them to maintain a diary where they can write the events of the day. it may be seen what is violent behaviour to one is not to another. the pattern is different. sometimes we play music for children and ask them to draw. we have noticed that after listening to techno music they draw ragged lines and after listening to classical music they draw rounded images. we analyse behavioural patterns. you have acted in several gujarati films, a french-sri lankan joint production and have been a major draw in peter brookes version of mahabharata in 1989. are you interested in working in hindi films? of course, i am if only i get the right kind of role. my first malayalam film, danny, has been released recently. i am playing the lead role of a 75-year-old retired school principal. the film is directed by national award winner t.v. chandran. i have also signed a bengali film which is written and will be directed by jayabrato chatterjee. the film is about falling in love at 50. the other characters are dimple kapadia and arjun chakraborty and the shooting will start at the end of this year. it will probably be called kichu polasher nesha. what is your experience in kolkata? i love the city and the audience here. i make it a point to come at least twice a year. what has been your experience in working with spastic and thalassaemic patients? i am just a facilitator in trying to open windows in peopleâ€™s life. you are a dancer, a theatre and film personality, an activist, a social worker. what is mallika? i am all of that but not bounded by any of them. you always wear different earrings in your ears. is it a fashion statement or does it define your personality? it defines my personality. it just shows that i make my own rules.

lucknow: uttar pradesh has suffered a setback in resource mobilisation for the 10th plan, which had projected the growth rate of the state at 8 per cent. against a target of rs 46,340 crore, the government could mobilise as much as rs 28, 000 crore, during the 9th plan, leaving a big gap to be bridged. this made the centre scale down the assistance for the state. the setback, obviously has placed uttar pradesh not only below the developed states like karnataka, maharashtra, tamil nadu and gujarat but also behind a poor state like bihar. the officials put the resource mobilisation rate of the state to 5.17 per cent against biharâ€™s 6.02 per cent. the poor mobilisation of resources during the 9th plan has adversely hit the the financing of ongoing projects, said a government official. official sources claim that the government suffered a setback for reasons beyond its control. they point out that out of the 365 working days, only 250 were available for official work. the rest, he said, were consumed by holidays, casual leaves availed by the staff, disruptions in work by natural calamities and law and order problems. although the government tried to bring things in order by curtailing the number of holidays, but couldnâ€™t attain much success. out of the three sources stateâ€™s finance â€” stateâ€™s own resources, further resources mobilisation (frm) and centreâ€™s assistance â€” stateâ€™s own resources stagnated at rs 4467.53 crore against projected rs 4938.68 crore in 2001-2002. in next financial year, this gap would be further widened â€” projected rs 5405.18 crore against actual rs 4142.56 crore. then on the frm head, the government could mobilise just rs 279.01 crore in 2001-2002. and thanks to poor resource mobilisation, state couldnâ€™t get the central assistance to its desired levels. in way of central assistance, it got rs 1450.42 crore in 2001 2002, which could have been much higher if the government had achieved its target. government sources say that state fell short of achieving its target of resource mobilisation because its revenue from the stateâ€™s provident funds, miscellaneous capital receipt and small savings fell short of its expectations. on the frm head, the government suffered a jolt in collecting additional central taxes, additional amounts against transfer of centre-sponsored schemes and market borrowings and also owing to its failure on negotiating loans from the lic, gic, rbi, idbi, and nabard, said an official of the finance department. as these gaps would widen every year, the state would be forced to cut its developmental schemes, much to the discomfort of the government of the day, said a top government official.",0,0,0,0,0

mumbai:as the gujarat situation went from bad to worse last week, hindu and muslim neighbours in the bit chawls at nagpada began parking their two-wheelers in separate lots. quick to realise what lay ahead, the local mohalla committee called a meeting of the residents and the parking reverted to secular pattern. with the two communities living cheek by jowl in several densely populated clusters in mumbai, it often takes the slightest of reasons to trigger communal tension. in the recent past, all it took for imamwada in central mumbai to come to the brink of a riot was when an old man in a balcony carelessly blew his nose on some youngsters below. in another case, the communal divide in madanpuraâ€™s afzal chawl came to the fore when water dripped onto some persons from linen left to dry on a second-floor clothesline. the 20-odd active mohalla committees in the city have faced sterner tests over the last year with the the fallout of the bamiyan buddha episode, the arrest of bal thackeray, the banning of simi and the terrorist attacks in new york and new delhi. in all these instances, they managed to nip the trouble in the bud. the acceptability of these panels stems from the fact that they are apolitical and their effectiveness is boosted because of their access to senior police officers. local mohalla committee leaders are often active in social work. for instance, advocate yasmin shaikh runs a free legal aid cell for women at madanpura whereas ajay kaul at yari road, andheri (w), is the principal of a local school and junior college which he started from scratch. however, mohalla committees still have a long way to go. even after ten years, these panels share an uneasy relationship with the police, who resent being questioned by mohalla committee members about cases of high-handedness. for instance, in 1997, the police refused to let the mohalla committee intervene in golibar, santa cruz (e), even when a police atrocity led to a minor riot in the slum. in fact, policemen at the lower level tend to reduce mohalla committees to a network of informants alerting them about communal trouble. in the absence of an effective local leader, as in behrampada, bandra (e), mohalla committees have been subverted by the police. in an especially bad case last year, a member of the midc mohalla committee was attacked by a local goon who ought to have been in police custody. these panels depend heavily on the clout of former police chiefs such as julio ribeiro, satish sahney and r.h. mendonca, trustees of the mohalla committee movement trust. despite these bigwigs, police commissioners such as r.d. tyagi have tried to dilute the effectiveness of these panels by forming parallel mohalla committees packed with members of dubious merit. mohalla committees could have been more effective had they been able to garner the support of civic authorities. however, the civic administration has been unable to convince its field officers to tie up with the committees for solving problems involving, say, water and garbage, that often lead to fights in slums. despite the negatives, it is the grit of dedicated mohalla committee workers and the commitment of retired bureaucrats that has seen the mohalla committees through ten years. their future as an effective organ of civil society now depends on the participation of public-spirited citizens in their activities.",0,1,1,1,0

331,310,"new delhi: a majority in the sangh parivar - whether in the rss itself or in the bjp and the vhp - want the godhra carnage to be delinked from the vhp build-up in ayodhya and has expressed unhappiness with appeals of prime minister atal bihari vajpayee and home minister l k advani to the vhp to scale down the temple stir in view of the communal conflagration in gujarat. â€˜â€˜why does the government want to fall into the opposition trap and use gujarat to cow down the vhp?â€™â€™ asked an rss source. several bjp mps, too, said they greatly resented the curbs placed on karsewaks entering ayodhya. their uniform line is that godhra is part of a series that includes the â€˜â€˜isi-inspired terroristâ€™â€™ attacks on the kashmir assembly and parliament. as for ramjanambhoomi, vhp leader say it should be addressed separately, and that the government must go to dharmacharyas and give them a â€˜â€˜written assuranceâ€™â€™, permitting them to place the pillars on the acquired site as the culmination of the year-long purnahuti yagya on march 15. only then would it be willing to postpone the announcement of the precise date of temple construction. the bjpâ€™s central leadership, taken aback at the resentment in the party (seen on thursday when bjp mps harangued pm vajpayee and home minister advani), the sangh and the vhp to its apparent â€˜â€˜capitulationâ€™â€™, tried hard on friday to regain some ground with its own people. on thursday, the pm and advani asked the rss to â€˜â€˜mediateâ€™â€™ with the vhp on its behalf, and later hrd minister murli manohar joshi and bjp mp balasaheb apte met rss leaders to try and work out a formula. rss chief sudershan also has been in touch with some vhp leaders. one formula being discussed, reportedly, is that the law ministry should request the supreme court to permit a part of the acquired land to be handed over the vhp before march 12. while the publicly stated priority is to check communal violence in gujarat, bjp ministers are apparently having to first prove their credentials with their own cadre. on friday, advani came to parliament with a prepared statement which would set some â€˜â€˜doubtsâ€™â€™ at rest. but when he was not allowed to do so, he called an impromptu press briefing at which he gave the details of the godhra carnage without any reference to the ayodhya issue. asked about his earlier statement - that the vhp build-up in ayodhya could lead to a serious law and order situation, which the government would not hesitate to deal with - he said he did not have anything to add. bjp leaders say they will tide over the present crisis, but then the partyâ€™s abysmal performance in the recent assembly polls has apparently triggered off a debate in the sangh parivar: whether this government should be â€˜â€˜savedâ€™â€™ to fight another day or whether, since its electoral downslide is being attributed to its shelving the hindutva agenda, it was time to cut its losses and begin afresh. thus far, the tilt is towards the first â€” saving the government.

333,320,"crushing defeat in one assembly after another. spectre of saffron-tinged rioting across the country. administrative helplessness reminiscent of november 1984 (anti-sikh riots) and december 1992 (demolition of babri masjid). and finally, after a swingeing budget, middle-class disillusionment with the bjp, once the great white hope of urban india. is it the beginning of the end for the nda? it is not necessary that a successive routs should rock the government at the centre. indira gandhi completed a term through electoral reverses in the states, as did rajiv gandhi and narasimha rao. however, it was thumbs down for all three, when the big elections came around: indira was facing a defeat in the lok sabha elections when she died. son rajiv exited office ingloriously. and rao met with the same fate. comparisons with the unstable governments at the centre in 1989, 1990 and 1996 are futile because each self-destructed before a substantive electoral verdict could be delivered. on the other hand, the nda, for all that it was written off, has shown remarkable staying power. with every crisis, the nda bandwagon has paradoxically grown longer. consider a few examples. the biju janata dal splits, but both factions opt to stay with the nda. the marumalarchi dmk (mdmk) exits from the dmk alliance, but not the nda. for the mdmk leader, vaiko, there is â€˜â€˜no greater leader than vajpayeeji.â€™â€™ the pattali makkal katchi (pmk) quits the nda to join jayalalithaâ€™s aiadmk, only to return five months on. party chief ramdoss insists he has â€˜â€˜full faith in the leadership of vajpayeeji.â€™â€™ ditto with the mercurial mamata banerji. she storms out of the nda, dallies with sonia but trudges back, singing the familiar song about â€˜â€˜strengthening vajpayeejiâ€™s hands.â€™â€™ if all this lavish praise has overwhelmed vajpayeeji, he has seen nothing yet. the latest on the coalition front is that bitter rivals, dmk and aiadmk, are vying for his affections. this is a political wonder made all the more remarkable by the ndaâ€™s dismal electoral record. in 1998, the coalition lost rajasthan, madhya pradesh and delhi. in 1999, the nda earned a second term courtesy kargil, but lost karnataka and maharashtra assemblies. in 2000, the nda partners mounted an extraordinary offensive against biharâ€™s laloo yadav, but suffered a shock defeat. in 2001, tamil nadu and assam proved a write off, as did the biggest surprise of them all, west bengal. today, the coalition has lost its mandate in punjab, uttaranchal and most crucially, up. just why hasnâ€™t the coalition unravelled? the answer to this lies in the predicament that is peculiar to the ndaâ€™s allies. put simply, it is a case of your enemyâ€™s enemy being your friend. the congress is a political enemy not just of the bjp, but of most the nda partners â€” the telugu desam, the national conference, the dmk, the akali dal, the bjiu janata dal, the indian national lok dal and the shiv sena. the cpm is again a common enemy of the bjp and the trinamool congress. and the numbers are such that no alternative coalition can come up without the congress and the cpm. it is true that many of the bjpâ€™s current partners had earlier co-habited with the congress. the congress propped up the united front governments, among whose constituents were dmk and tdp. however, these coalitions came apart precisely because of this contradiction. is the nda invincible, then? no. the bedrock on which the nda stands is the jointly drafted â€˜â€˜national agendaâ€™â€™ which categorically rejects ayodhya. when the same issue returns, and on a scale so large as to threaten the peace of the country, the constituents can hardly afford not to rethink their strategies. if not in the interest of the country, then, certainly in the interest of their own ostensibly secular constituencies. when that happens, it may be over to sonia gandhi.

""government should immediately lift the restrictions. these are causing a lot of hardships to the people of ayodhya,"" convenor of the ram janambhoomi trust ramchandra paramhans said. he said such moves would not have any positive effect on peace efforts. ""these restrictions are unnecessary and are compounding the problems,"" said local bjp mla lallu singh, who is closely associated with the ram temple programme. local vhp leaders, however, asserted that the restrictions would not be able to dampen the spirit of kar sevaks and the temple construction programme would go on as per schedule. vhp president ashok singhal was expected to reach here on saturday but according to vhp office-bearers his programme had been postponed because of some unexplained reasons. meanwhile, security arrangements are tighter as the march 15 deadline draws closer. a three-stage checking is conducted on all persons and vehicles despite proper passes. no other vehicle is allowed to ply into and inside ayodhya.

kolkata: the cpm has urged all the political parties in west bengal to be on the streets and maintain vigil to stop possible attempts to disturb peace in the wake of ongoing communal frenzy in gujarat and other parts of the country. the forward bloc, meanwhile, demanded that the bajrang dal and vishwa hindu parishad, the two sangh parivar organisations responsible for the gujarat carnage, be banned forthwith. state secretary of the cpm, anil biswas, said on friday that while the administration was taking all precautionary measures to maintain peace in every corner of the state, it was necessary for the political parties to remain alert. left front chairman biman bose appealed to the people not to fall prey to rumours. ""i appeal to all the political parties, including the congress and the trinamul congress to take to the street. even during the 1992 riots we had issued similar appeal,"" biswas said. the two leaders congratulated the people for refusing to respond to the bharat bandh call given by the vhp during the day. the cpm discussed the issue during its state secretariat meeting where chief minister buddhadeb bhattacharjee reported on the latest situation. both bhattacharjee and state labour minister md amin cancelled their proposed trip to delhi where they were supposed attend the cpm central committee meeting. the trinamul congress, however, has decided to adopt a different strategy to maintain communal harmony. they will refrain from holding processions and rallies which often add to tension in communally-sensitive times. on friday, trinamul supremo mamata banerjee instructed her party leaders and workers not to hit the streets with rallies as decided by the cpm. holding rallies will only aggravate the situation by pitting one group against the other, banerjee pointed out. ""incidents in gujarat are unfortunate. we have seen what riots and communal tension mean. there is no point in organising rallies and processions, thereby contributing to the tension that is already prevailing in the country,"" banerjee said. the party has also deferred its madrasah education convention scheduled for march 2 in the light of disturbances in gujarat. trinamulâ€™s strategy to deal with the communal problem is in sharp contrast with that taken by the cpm who has been organising processions in the localities in order to maintain peace and tranquility. ""such a strategy will only fuel the tension by highlighting it,"" banerjee explained. the stand taken by trinamul will also mean the partyâ€™s refusal to respond to a call by the cpm to fight the communal menace in the state unitedly. the trinamul camp, however, maintained that by deciding to hit the streets, the cpm was merely trying to regain the ground they had lost following the madrassah controversy.

mumbai: the state police have launched a massive operation against kar sevaks moving towards ayodhya.

reacting to intelligence inputs, that large-scale reprisal acts could take place in view of the violence in gujarat, the state police have ordered that immediate preventive action should be taken against as many kar sevaks as possible.

as a result, around 681 kar sevaks belonging to the vishwa hindu parishad, (vhp) the bajrang dal and the durga vahini have already been booked in the state.

the state headquarters has also ordered that all policemen on leave should be recalled and barring medical emergencies all leave to police personnel stands cancelled.

in a terse note sent over the wireless, the state police headquarters has asked all police commissioners, district and railway police chiefs to provide immediate information of the action taken against the kar sevaks.

``it has been noticed that communication of action taken regarding important events is not promptly reported to the state police control room,'''' the note states.

the state control room has also sought a daily report from each district regarding important events in their area by 4 a.m. each day. officials have been instructed to ensure compliance of the same over the phone.

the wireless messages also note that a large number of kar sevaks are proceeding to ayodhya from various parts of the state despite the fact that the district administration of faizabad in uttar pradesh has already issued prohibitory orders in and around the temple town.

the intelligence machinery in maharashtra has observed that over 2,500 kar sevaks had already visited ayodhya before february 27 when it received orders from the union home ministry to act against them. of these, around 1,300 kar sevaks participated in the poornahuti yagna that began at ayodhya on february 24.

the vhp has directed all its district units to mobilise 1000 ``ram sevaks'''' each for the 101-day yagna programme in ayodhya. the vhp hopes that over 20 lakh kar sevaks will gather in ayodhya during this period.

the union home ministry has also alerted all state headquarters and asked them to prevent the kar sevaks from reaching ayodhya. however, the state intelligence agencies have found that despite clear instructions a large number of kar sevaks are still travelling to ayodhya.

the union home ministry has ordered that all ground-level intelligence should be directly shared with central intelligence agencies.

the state government apprehends reprisal killings in many places in view of the march 13 deadline set by the vhp for a `bhoomipujan'' at the disputed site in ayodhya in the backdrop of the communal violence at godhra in which 58 kar sevaks returning from ayodhya were burnt alive.

on march 5, another message relayed by the state headquarters to all police commissioners and district superintendents says that the continuous influx of kar sevaks towards ayodhya could cause unprecedented chaos and will eventually create a serious law and order situation. the message goes on to warn that the movement of the kar sevaks should be stopped immediately and any laxity in this regard will be viewed adversely.

intelligence officials blamed local police officials for the violence in murbad near thane on march 1 during the maharashtra bandh called by the vhp and on march 6 in bhingar in ahmednagar, an already communally sensitive town, which reported sporadic violence when some obscene messages were found written on a school blackboard.",0,1,1,0,0

ahmedabad: it''s a strange coincidence. apparently, the news of sonia gandhi''s visit to gujarat happens to coincide with the state machinery waking up from its slumber and begin the much-needed relief work. the ahmedabad collector and state relief commissioner claim that besides starting new relief camps, help has been pouring in the existing ones for the last two days - nearly four days after violence broke out in the state. ""we are on our toes for the last two days, having helped over 17,000 people in 14 relief camps. around nine camps have been started through the aanganwadi - government relief providing body,"" says g c murmu, state relief commissioner. however, a visit to some of the city relief camps gives a completely different picture. speaking to most of the relief camps revealed that official help started coming only from tuesday. ""they should''ve swung into action the very next day. what were they waiting for, for so long!"" thundered chairman standing committee, amc, badruddin sheikh. and though help may have started reaching the camps, it is nowhere close to what is needed, believe many. ""we had handed over the list of our demands - basic amenities like water, tents, medical aid and of course, food - on friday itself. however, it was only on tuesday that some people from the collectorate visited our camp. and all that we were provided with, was a very small quantity of foodgrain which can hardly suffice for the 3,500 people staying here. however, drinking water remains the biggest problem,"" says inamul iraqi of the shahibaug dariakhan ghummat relief camp. people at almost all the relief camps share the same sentiments. ""we received some flour and foodgrain on wednesday. besides food, we need medicines and more toilets. if things continue like this, there could be an outbreak of diseases,"" says yakubbhai of the bhogilal ni chal relief camp at rajpur ''tol naka'', which houses around 500 affected people. so while the collectorate sources claim to have reached out to 11,400 people, providing them with 80 ''boris'' (sacks) each of flour and foodgrain, people at relief camps deny having received any. ""if they call a 2.5 kg bag a sack, it''s their misconception,"" is how an organiser at the jahangirnagar amina masjid relief camp at vatva reacted. the silver lining, however, is all the work done by several non-government organisations throughout the city. around 21 organisations have been providing succour to the affected people under the banner of citizen''s initiative. it was the st xavier''s social service society (sxsss) that reached out to the strife-torn areas with cooked food on thursday itself. ""in no time, we managed to garner support from a lot of other voluntary organisations,"" says fr victor moses, director of sxsss. ""just now, we are focusing only on the camps, supplying food items, medicines, clothes and tarpaulin sheets. there are around 20 camps with 35 to 40,000 people. the relief teams are constantly facing the problems of security. we requested the police commissioner for escorting the convoy, but he refused. however, the meeting with the collector has been positive,"" says a citizen''s initiative source.

mumbai: when mobs attacked juzer bandukwalaâ€™s house during the recent communal riots in gujarat, it hardly took into account that the physics professor with m.s. university, baroda, was a staunch gandhian and had always worked towards communal harmony. on february 28, the mob burnt down mr bandukwalaâ€™s bungalow in a cosmopolitan part of baroda and bayed for his blood, branding him an isi agent. he was lucky to escape to a neighbourâ€™s house. a day earlier, a mob had stoned his house, damaged one of his cars and burnt the other. that evening, some vhp supporters with whom he had good relations told him to forget the incident. â€œkai pan nathi (thereâ€™s nothing to it),â€™â€™ they said, assuring him that there was no ill feeling towards him. but the next day, the mob returned with iron rods and petrol bombs. the vice-president of the gujarat unit of the peopleâ€™s union for civil liberties, mr bandukwala has always been an admirer of mahatma gandhi and a critic of m.a. jinnah. he is today troubled, not by the terrible losses he has suffered, but by the ghastly instances of dehumanisation. â€œgujarat accounts for the maximum number of atrocities against women and dalits,â€™â€™ he says. â€œwhy is this happening in the land ofmahatma gandhi?â€™â€™ baroda, which is known as sanskari nagari (a centre of culture), has always been considered an exception.there has always been much interaction between the two communities. â€œevery year on october 2, for example, we organise a special function to felicitate bright muslim children,â€™â€™ says mr bandukwala. â€œthe idea is to inculcate a feeling among children that mahatma gandhi did a lot for muslims.â€™â€™ but during the last fortnight, baroda also witnessed large-scale violence and a systematic attack on the economy of muslims. â€œbut their economy is intertwined with the economy of the hindus,â€™â€™ he said, pointing out that no big industrial unit would now dream of coming to gujarat.â€œthere is a cultural poverty in gujarat, the intellectual ferment is missing.â€™â€™ mr bandukwala strongly believes that there is only one path to peaceâ€”strengthening the human rights movement and doing away with talk of â€˜majorityâ€™ and â€˜minorityâ€™ in a country where the muslim population is greater than that of pakistan.â€œwe need to talk of respect for other religions,â€™â€™ he says, adding that the gujarati media played a very negative role during the riots.â€œtolerance is an inadequate concept.â€™â€™",0,0,0,0,0

395,436,"new delhi: the bjp-led central government has begun exploring the possibility of permitting bhoomi puja in ayodhya on march 15. this comes in the wake of an assurance from the kanchipuram shankaracharya that the ceremony would be â€˜â€˜symbolic, without building materials, carved pillars or concentration of kar sevaksâ€™â€™. he gave this assurance at a meeting chaired by prime minister vajpayee on thursday night. the shankaracharya has conveyed this to the all-india muslim personal law board and said the question of handing over the undisputed land will be dealt with after march 15. their response is awaited. government sources said besides ensuring the security situation in ayodhya was conducive, muslim approval was essential to â€˜â€˜sellâ€™â€™ the puja to the bjpâ€™s allies and the opposition. vhp cadres have not taken kindly to ashok singhalâ€™s promise in his capacity as managing trustee of the ramjanambhoomi nyas that the court verdict in the ayodhya case would be obeyed. the promise may have made it possible for the government to consider allowing the puja, but vhp cadres view it as a sell-out. on friday, vhpâ€™s international president v h dalmia said the vhp would obey the court verdict, but if it went against the rjn, the dharmacharyas would decide the next step. asked if he was not contradicting singhalâ€™s statement on thursday that if the verdict went in favour of the muslims, the garbha griha location would be changed, he evaded a direct reply. much spadework behind the scenes is understood to have been done by spiritual leader sri sri ravi shankar. the guru reportedly held extensive discussions with vhp leader ashok singhal and persuaded him to give the clearest possible written commitment that his organisation will abide by the court verdict. sri sri ravi shankar is also said to be holding parleys with a cross section of muslim leaders to find a durable settlement to the ayodhya crisis. vhp joint general secretary onkar bhave said the bhoomi puja would be incomplete without shifting building materials, carved pillars and at least 2,000 kar sevaks. simultaneously, 14 bjp mps from up held out a veiled threat of confrontation with the government. in a letter to the pm on thursday, they said the â€˜â€˜anger among people is increasing, and soon it would be manifested against the governmentâ€™s hitler-like tactics on the streets.â€™â€™ the impact of this letter was felt on friday when minister of state for home id swami, who has gone to ayodhya to assess the security situation, announced the lifting of curbs on the residents of ayodhya, permission for pilgrims, not kar sevaks, and resumption of trains from saturday.

""i am a practising muslim and islam does not teach me to hate other religions. even koran says that ""allah is rabbil-alamin which means ''lord of all'' and not merely ''rabbil-muslamin'' that is ''lord of muslims alone''"", mohammedbhai says. the tradition of mutual respect and love is passed on to the next generation. while ramanlal''s son amit prides himself in saying that he is the only brother of seven sisters, his son-in-law haresh hirabhai mali considers mohammedbhai as his guardian.

ahmedabad: union finance minister yashwant sinha has unwittingly given a gift to amdavadis. a gift that would help ahmedabad municipal corporation (amc) bridge the disparity of civic amenities between the eastern and western parts of the city. storm water drainage system, flyovers and better solid waste management would be the immediate benefits coming to citizens by the end of this year. the amc is now looking towards over-subscription of its rs 100-crore tax-free non-convertible debentures, which had been under a shadow since riots shattered peace in the city. the cause for this is that the finance minister has struck off tax-free debentures from the budgetary outlay for 2002-03. the result is that amc''s tax-free bonds that had been sanctioned in september, 2001, is now much in demand. the civic authority in its appeal to various banking and financial institutions has said: ""the proceeds of these redeemable and tax-free bonds will be used to part finance water supply augmentation scheme and setting up of sewage disposal and sanitation systems in the eastern areas of city. the present bond offers tax-free returns of nine per cent per annum semi-annually (payable on march 1 and september 1) for a 10-year tenure."" sources in amc disclosed that the union bank of india has already paid rs 25 crore (each bond is worth rs 1 lakh with minimum subscription of 10 debentures). both the state bank of saurashtra and the gujarat state finance corporation, too, have bought rs 5-crore worth of bonds each. the civic body expects another rs 10-crore worth of investment from the central bank of india. while for the investors, the bonds would translate into tax-free dividends, for the amc, the money would mean work on pending civic projects that would start from april, 2002. the non-convertible debentures have waited over a year now to reach this ''pink'' status. on march 2, 2001, amc''s standing committee had passed a resolution clearing issuance of rs 100-crore civic bond. the bond could not meet its target for completing all formalities by march 31. economic recession and non-conducive market conditions had further delayed the bond issue. next came an ""in financial doldrums"" status for the amc which had the incumbent municipal commissioner p panneervel putting the bond issue on hold. now with an elite tax-free status and a gradually improving financial condition, the amc feels time is right to go public and cash in when the investors are ready to spend in new financial year. way back in 1998, the amc had earned accolades as a trend-setter. it had earned a distinction of being the first municipal corporation in india to issue rs 100-crore worth of public bonds backed by an enviable aa(so) rating by crisil. this time too the civic body has become the first in the country to raise money through tax-free public bonds from large financial and commercial organisations. the municipal commissioner, p panneervel, told tnn: ""the response to these bonds is quite encouraging. already an investment of rs 45 crore has been made in the first couple of days after launching the bond. we hope to get enough investors within a short time."" he added, ""we are helped by the fact that the bond has got a unique status of being civic debentures that would give investors tax-free returns. we hope to reach the rs 100-crore mark soon enough to start implementing civic infrastructure strengthening projects by april, 2002. our aim is to have storm water drainage and sewerage pipeline network in place before the next monsoon. especially for areas under amc''s east municipal zonal office. the other areas of city (apart from the pipeline network) would be benefited by flyovers and bridges that would ease pressure on city''s thoroughfares.""",0,0,0,0,0

""we are trying to resolve the matter, we need all support,"" he said. the prime minister said the situation in ayodhya was peaceful and fully under control. security had been tightened and the lifting of some restrictions had been done so only to facilitate the public. the government, he reiterated, was committed to protecting status quo and the supreme court''s verdict on ayodhya. while members of opposition parties voiced the fear that a situation similar to that in 1992 was building up in ayodhya, nda allies the trinamul congress and the telugu desam party also pleaded with vajpayee to ensure that nothing untoward took place on march 15, the date set by the vhp for bhoomi pujan. trinamul chief mamata banerjee said in light of what had happened in gujarat and in west bengal and the experience of 1992, it was imperative to ensure that nothing happened in ayodhya again. tdp leader in lok sabha yerran naidu pointed out that certain ministers had made remarks at odds with the prime minister''s assertions and this caused confusion. he also sought adequate forces in ayodhya. shiv sena, however, struck a combative tone saying puja should not be stalled. bjp mp and bajrang dal chief vinay katiyar said ""nothing will happen on march 15"". later, the congress raised objections to vajpayee''s reply in house. for one, said spokesman jaipal reddy, the prime minister was ""deliberately confusing acquired land with undisputed land."" he also accused the government of ""deliberately abdicating its responsibility to take a stand of its own"" on the vhp plan for symbolic puja. ""the land belongs to the government, the government has to take a stand"", he said. the party has taken umbrage at vajpayee projecting the vhp commitment that it will abide by a court verdict ""as a great concession.""

members of the delegation also told the governor that acts of violence against the muslims of mumbai could not be ruled out. the governor assured the delegation that he would send their memorandum to the president and convey their apprehensions to the state government.

ahmedabad: special inspector general of police a i saiyed recalls that a few years ago he had inspired residents of the largely muslim village of ganvada in siddhpur taluka of patan district to build a shiva temple because the village didn''t have any temple. he had even organised a grand inauguration of the temple in 1998, inviting all residents of the neighbouring 15 villages. but, last thursday when he was mobbed by about 500 persons at vejalpur in ahmedabad while he was driving to the gujarat police academy, of which he is a joint director, it wasn''t really the opportune time to talk about his contribution to the hindu community. this required some quick thinking because the violent mob had intercepted his official car, complete with a red light on top, two stars which represent his rank as igp and even a police flag! saiyad recalled that he was aware that the situation was tense because of the godhra train massacre the previous day and the fact that the vhp had given a call for bandh on thursday. ""i was confident that nothing would happen. i was in my police uniform and i had an armed commando with me,"" he said. when the driver of his car saw the mob ahead, he suggested to saiyad that they turn back and speed away. but saiyad told him to drive on. that was his mistake. the restive crowd, thinking that he is a senior police official, told him to see that the road leading to juhapura, which had been blocked by residents, is opened. saiyad told them that they should approach the local police for this job as he was with the police academy . then, suddenly, somebody noticed the name tag on his uniform and shouted ""arre aa to saiyad chhe (hey, he is a saiyad)"". on hearing this the mob immediately attacked his car and started stoning his vehicle. the driver showed presence of mind and drove away. saiyad is shaken by the experience but clearly underplays his feelings when he says the incident had ""pinched"" him. he has seen many riots before as an ips officer, even in ahmedabad as a dcp in 1985 and 1992. ""but this was different. its the first time that people saw me as a muslim and not as a police officer who commands a lot of respect in the force,"" he said, the sadness clearly reflected in his voice. he said he had trained nearly 10,000 policemen in gujarat in the police training college in junagadh and now in the police academy besides working in the field as an officer in many districts. asked whether he agreed with the view that the police was sluggish in its response to the riots, he said: ""i''ve read the comments of former dgp m m singh, whom i consider my guru, as saying that the police action was sluggish."" obviously, saiyad didn''t want to comment any further on the issue. he, however, said he was overwhelmed by the anxious inquiries made by his hindu friends about his well-being. ""i''m not afraid of anything even today, but my boys in the academy now insist that they come and pick me up everyday and drop me back home. i find it rather embarrassing because i''m a police officer and i''m capable of protecting not only myself but society,"" he said. nearly 135 of his recruits, who were being trained at the academy, had been despatched to various districts to help police control the situation, he said.

new delhi: a lawyerâ€™s body has sought to offer solution for the ongoing dispute over construction of a temple in ayodhya. united lawyersâ€™ front (ulf) has urged the supreme court, which is already seized of three petitions against unauthorised construction of a temple at the acquired disputed site, to order setting up a body of eminent people to oversee simultaneous construction of a temple and a mosque at some other place. petitioner organisationâ€™s president anis suhrawardy, who is also standing counsel for the j&k government, said the ayodhya issue was affecting the â€˜â€˜secular fabricâ€™â€™ of the country and hence it was necessary to apprise the court to restrain the government from â€˜â€˜subjecting itself to the pressure of either vishwa hindu parishad (vhp) or babri masjid action committee (bmac). this could be done by â€œconstituting a committee of former chief justices, judges, eminent jurists, journalists and people from the field of art and culture belonging to both the communities to undertake the work of construction of ram mandir and simultaneously of a masjidâ€�, said the petition which may also be heard along with mohammad aslam bhureâ€™s petition on march 13 by a bench headed by justice b n kirpal. â€˜â€˜since there is a general belief of the hindu community that disputed site was the birth place of lord rama and since a masjid existed at the site before its demolition, there is no harm that a ram mandir could be constructed over the disputed siteâ€™â€™, suharawardy said. â€œon the other hand, the masjid, which was constructed there, is although of special significance to the entire nation especially to the muslim community but has no co-relation with the site of dispute and could be constructed anywhere,â€� he added. bhure has, however, sought deployment of the army at the disputed site besides preventing the karsewaks from reaching ayodhya and seizure of the stone pillars and other works lying at karsevak puram near ayodhya and pindwara in rajasthan. the apex court would hear on march 15 another petition filed by lawyer syed shakil ahmad on behalf of mohammad hashim seeking contempt of court action against vhp leadership and former uttar pradesh chief minister rajnath singh for violating the status quo orders in ayodhya.",0,0,1,0,0

ahmedabad: vishwa hindu parishad, which has called for a gujarat bandh on thursday, has described the godhra incident as a ''manifestation of islamic fundamentalism'' and has given a 24-hour ultimatum to the state government to bring the culprits involved in the incident to book.

420,130,"new delhi: the gruesome tragedy at godhra railway station, was â€˜â€˜waiting to happen.â€™â€™ yet, this important station with a railway protection force post of around 50 armed policemen could do little to stop the mob from torching the sabarmati express on february 27 â€” and thereby the entire state. the posse from the state governmentâ€™s government railway police (grp) too failed to protect passengers. for the past three weeks, the three sabarmati expresses have been carrying karsevaks to and from ayodhya, halting daily at godhra. according to a railway official, the area surrounding the godhra railway station is predominantly muslim and most of the vendors at the station are muslim. â€˜â€˜it was a regular feature to see vishwa hindu parishad cadre getting down at godhra station and shouting provocative slogans.â€™â€™ despite the atmosphere getting vitiated and the possibility of daily provocation, the railways and the state government did not seem to have put its policemen on alert. the protection of railway property is the concern of the rpf, but it failed to guard the train that was torched at the outer signal of the station. passenger safety comes under the jurisdiction of the state governmentâ€™s grp. at the railway board here, officials allege that most of the rpf and grp men on duty were not available when the mobs attacked the train. but railway minister nitish kumar said that he checked out the facts and was sure that the rpf tried its best to tackle the situation. â€˜â€˜outside vital installations, the rpf is not empowered to open fire. we are seeking an amendment to the railway act and rpf act to get it empowered so that it would be responsible to tackle such situations. what can the people at the station do? maintaining peace and law and order is the responsibility of the state government. how can railway personnel anticipate trouble?â€™â€™ asked nitish kumar, who has cancelled his scheduled patna trip to monitor the situation. rail bhawan has not officially commented on the sequence of events that led to the death of 58 people. so far, the ministry has not explained how many rpf and grp men were on duty and why there was no intelligence input from the local administration and precautionary action against the worsening mood on the godhra railway station. also officials have not explained how a 2000-strong mob â€” if that indeed was the figure â€” could collect on the railway track and how the armed rpf and the grp failed to disperse them. the suspicion that godhra incident was â€˜â€˜premeditatedâ€™â€™ brings the railway and state policeâ€™s inaction into sharper focus. another cause for concern is the bulk booking of tickets by politicians for the karsevaks. kumar pointed out that, â€˜â€˜rules permit bulk booking of tickets and anybody can do it. but now we have stopped it for obvious reasons.â€™â€™

patiala: after a long period of seven years, smiles have returned on the faces of potato growers in punjab. the rate of the potato crop was decreasing every year and during last season in september-october 2000, the farmers, especially in the doaba region, were forced to throw their yield on the roads for which the police had registered cases against the farmers. in many other areas of the state the farmers had not gone to lift their bags kept in the stores as the rent of the stored crop was much higher than the market price of the yield and they were not in position to pay the rent of the stored yield. this year the situation is totally different. in the beginning of the present season in the last week of october 2001, the rate of fresh potatoes had gone up to rs 700 per bag and there was good demand of the yield in delhi, uttar pradesh and gujarat due to which most of the farmers started sending their entire yield to the mandis, disclosed amrik singh of raisal village. according to an estimate the farmers sent their fifty per cent of crop to the mandis in the early months of the season. however, the early crop was under blight disease in many areas of the state and the yield was less than the expectations but there was no loss to the farmers and many of them sold the entire crop even without sparing seed for the next year. however, the present market price of the potato is rs 275 per bag of 80 kg bag as compared to the last season''s price of rs 80 per bag, but at present the potato seed is being sold at the rate of rs 500 per bag. it is worth while to note that the rate of the crop is increasing day by day since the last week as the farmers have started storing their yield in hand in hope of more profit. on the other hand the cold storage owners are not in high spirit as they feel that the season would again not be fruitful for them. inderjit singh of ghundar cold store near amloh said that during the last season, they were not even paid the rent of the potato storage by the farmers and they were forced to sell them in the mandis at a throwaway price and after selling the stored yield in the mandis they could not get return even on their expenditures. however, in the last october, the market was high and the farmers got a good return of the stored yield but this market trend was going against them as most of the farmers had already sold their fresh yield in the market and had nothing to store in the cold storages, he said. inderjit further disclosed that under the present circumstances, their cold storages might end up utilising only half of their capacity.",0,0,1,0,0

vadodara: with kyonki saas bhi kabhi bahu thi kick-starting the female foeticide controversy, sahiyar, a city-based woman''s organisation has organised a unique competition of short story, play, songs and poetry writing on the theme of promoting the girl child and showing female foeticide in poor light. the competition would provide a counterpoint to what many ngos feel is the increasing incidence of popular serials showing women as subservient to men. the most blatant example was a recent episode of kyonki saas bhi kabhi bahu thi, where a couple is congratulated after a sex-determination test predicts the foetus is male. the serial is reported to have been ''awarded'' the duryodhana award by an ngo in mumbai for its depiction of women in poor light. many activists are also worried because the statistics of the male-female ratio in gujarat is alarming. for children between 0 to 6 years the number of girls per 1000 boys is 878. there are 36.5 lakh boys and 32.11 lakh girls, the shortfall of girls to equal boys is almost 4 lakh informs trupti shah of sahiyar. ""another reason for organising this competition is to get people to start thinking on the issue of the girl child and the concept of female foeticide. most people do not think on these issues as it is not written about, as there is a lacunae of literature on female foeticide. ""this competition would give us an opportunity to tap the literary talent amongst the people and at the same time get them to think on these issues"" she said. according to her, the issue of female foeticide as a concept by itself is accepted in many parts of the country and specifically in gujarat too. ""even in this age, we have seen well-to-do families opting to kill the foetus when they find it to be a female. they go for illegal sex determination and this is proved in the decreasing female to male ratio. ""this is a dangerous trend, as in normal circumstances in any society it has been found that the number of women is more than the number of men. the lower number of girls indicates that selective killing of female foetus exists. this fact is backed by research too"", she says. in the country as a whole too, the number of women per 1000 men has decreased over the years. in 1901, for every 1000 men there were 972 women and this number has reduced in the current years to 933. in gujarat, the statistics are much worse for every 1000 men there are 919 women indicating that the craze for male heir has driven parents to kill the female foeticide. there is a need to increase awareness about this trend. in societies where the women are fewer in number, sexual abuse and rape too are common. the competition is open to all those who are above 13 years and groups too can participate by sending in joint entries. the age group of members in the group should range between 13 to 17, 18 to 21 and 22 above. the story word length should not be beyond 800 to 1000 words and for plays it should be between 1,500 to 3,000. the last date for entry is march 15. all entries should be sent to sahiyar at g 3 shivanjali flat, opposite navjivan post office, ajwa road. for more information contact on 513482.

Â Â hindi    vhp vice-president giriraj kishore contradicted the statement made by the shankaracharya on tuesday that the parishad had agreed to abide by a court verdict. ""we have not given an undertaking that we will abide by any verdict of the court. we have only said in a written assurance that the status quo will be maintained at the disputed site,"" he said. kishore said he was quoting the exact statement in the written assurance given to the shankaracharya and signed by ram janmabhoomi trust president mahant ramchandradas paramhans. on a day when there were some positive developments like the centre moving the allahabad high court to expediate a verdict in the ayodhya case, and hectic parleys continued in the capital to find a workable solution, the vhp stand struck a discordant note. though vhp leaders have repeatedly said that they hope the kanchi seer - who is mediating in the dispute - will find a solution, they don''t seem to put too much in store by the formula he presented on tuesday. a senior leader said there was little hope of the latest proposal actually helping to arrive at a solution. there is also a fear that the all india muslim personal law board may approach court to get a stay on the vhp''s programme. the parishad also made clear on wednesday that rebuilding of the babri mosque at the disputed site would not be acceptable. ""it was and is and will remain a temple of ram lalla,"" kishore said. asked about vhp working president ashok singhal''s meeting on wednesday morning with the kanchi seer, kishore said ""nothing has been communicated yet as a final decision is expected only when the shankaracharya meets the prime minister today evening."" the seer stayed back an extra day in the capital to meet the prime minister again as well as some other politicians and leading lawyers to explore options for a solution to the ayodhya imbroglio. he also spoke to several imams and other muslim leaders. the vhp is dismissive of the muslim leadership participating in the talks, pointing out that there seems to be a lack of agreement among various factions. religious leaders like the shahi imam of the jama masjid in delhi have questioned the muslim law board''s authority in this regard. members of the board had met the shankaracharya on tuesday and have called an emergency meeting on march 10 to deliberate on his proposal. kishore was also dismissive about the shankaracharya of govardhan puri aadhog shajananda tirth, who attacked the vhp as ""anti-social elements"" here on wednesday. terming him a ""pretender"" and a ""self-proclaimed"" shankaracharya, kishore pointed out that the real seer of puri mutth was swami nischalananda. aadhog shajananada, he said, was not even recognised by the other shankaracharyas themselves. related stories Â court petitioned to remove curbs on kar sevaksÂ muslim board threatens to pull outÂ centre moves hc to speed up ayodhya caseÂ kanchi seer postpones return homeÂ we agreed because pm was involved: muslim panel

kolkata: two of the biggest parties in west bengal, the cpm and the trinamul congress, failed to reach a consensus in condemning the recent violent incidents in gujarat. till late tuesday evening, the two sides could not decide upon the text of a draft resolution that was to be moved in the assembly on wednesday. speaking to tnn in the evening, leader of opposition pankaj banerjee said that the possibility of reaching a consensus was remote. the difference in perception was reportedly on how to condemn the gujarat incident. according to left front chief whip lakshmi dey, the trinamul side suggested an amendment to draft whereby it would like to expunge the reasons behind the presence of karsevaks at godhra station on the fateful day. â€œwe wanted to condemn sangh parivarâ€™s call to start ram mandir construction from march 15 which led to the gathering of karsevaks, the incident at godhra and the riots thereafter,â€� dey pointed out. according to dey, one has to reach a root cause of a problem before taking a stand. the feeling on the treasury bench side is that it was not possible for the trinamul, that has stood by the prime minister on the gujarat issue, to condemn the reasons behind the gathering of the karsevaks as it would go against bjpâ€™s line.the trinamul side, however, feels that more than a genuine condemnation of the incident, the left front is more keen on appeasing muslims. that is why the resolution was ambiguous in pinpointing the miscreants at godhra, they say. â€œwe have told the left front chief whip that even left front chairman biman basu has publicly condemned the incident at godhra railway station. why cant the left front do the same,â€� asked opposition whip sobhandeb chattopadhyay. however, most parties are united in demanding dismissal of gujarat chief minister narendra modi and handing over of the stateâ€™s law and order machinery to the army. cpm politburo member sitaram yechuri said in kolkata on wednesday the opposition would corner the treasury benches on the issue when parliament opened on wednesday after a two-day adjournment. â€œwe are not specifying which article or act the government has to invoke in riot-ravaged gujarat. but the situation is extremely grave and progressively spinning out of control. it has to be stopped at any cost. given the state police forceâ€™s partisan action, only the army can restore normality,â€� yechuri said on tuesday. though he mentioned both article 355 of the constitution and the armed forces special power act as possible ways of intervention, but did not narrow down on one. while the former allows centreâ€™s intervention for restoration of law and order in a state, that latter allows the army to gauge the situation and deploy forces independent of directions from the state government. referring to the cpmâ€™s ideological opposition to article 356, yechuri emphasised that the situation in gujarat warranted the army to be in control. â€œthe situation in gujarat is extremely grave and fast attaining a proportion that is worse than even the mumbai riots in 1992,â€� he said. while violence has been contained in urban gujarat and cities like ahmedabad, surat, baroda are now under control, it was spreading like wildfire in the districts and villages. yechuri, samajwadi party general secretary amar singh, rajya sabha mp shabana azmi and raj babbar visited the strife-torn state last week but were refused security to tour the cities. â€œgeorge fernandesâ€™ motorcade was stoned. when even the defence minister is vulnerable and points to lapses on the part of the state including a delayed deployment of the army, how can the chief minister continue in office? thereâ€™s the added fear of the violence spreading to other states if it is not contained soon,â€� he said. yechuri was speaking to newspersons after a post-budget discussion. convenor of the economic affairs committee of bjp, jagdish shettigar, who was also present at the discussion, fumbled in his defence of modi. â€œwe become emotional and played right into the hands of our pakistanâ€™s inter services intelligence. though the isiâ€™s direct link has not been proved yet, we know itâ€™s a conspiracy to destabilise the nation,â€� he said. gujarat has been extensively discussed at the national security advisory board of the government. though yechuri and shettigar differed on the fate of modi, both admitted that indian polity had failed to bring the two communities together. â€œof course, itâ€™s a failure on the part of political parties and their policies. the gujarat eposide is a gory pointer to the religious polarity and ethnic diversity of our people and how a lack of mutual respect can threaten the countryâ€™s integrity,â€� yechuri added.",0,0,1,1,0

gandhinagar: the state government''s interim report to the national human rights commission, sent on saturday, contains a sequel of events, giving reasons why the riots took place after the godhra train burning incident. the report, however, refuses to call the riots that followed in the state as a ""reaction"" to what happened at godhra, as many a ruling politician describes them. it suggests, whatever happened thereafter was an ""expected repercussion"", though the state did not want them to happen. the report claims, as it had anticipated what was to come, the state government called para-military forces on february 27 itself. giving reasons for so many deaths during such a short duration, the report points out that this time the riots were more widespread than any time earlier. they took place in those areas of ahmedabad which were never considered sensitive before. it does not believe there was any intelligence failure. the mobs were huge, yet the riots were controlled in the shortest duration. meanwhile, the death toll in the worst-ever communal carnage in gujarat, starting with the godhra train burning incident on february 27, reached an all-time high of 726 on monday. the toll mounted so high amidst hectic preparations in the top corridors of power to face the two-day visit of the national minorities commission under the chairmanship of justice mohammad shamim starting march 13. the commission visits gujarat even as the state government finally managed to fulfil the national human rights commission order to send a preliminary report on the riots at the earliest. the figure of 726 includes the 60 who are reported dead in the gruesome train burning case. police sources gave these numbers here on monday, bypassing the strict secrecy prevailing over them. meanwhile, additional chief secretary (home) ashok narayan said, ""no list has been prepared of those missing."" not to predict how much the toll would ultimately reach or how many might be missing, he added, ""no new incidents are being reported. only bodies of those who died during the riots in the first few days are being compiled."" the national minorities commission members have requested the state government to arrange meetings with gujarat governor s s bhandari and chief minister narendra modi after it takes a round of certain riot-affected areas of the state on thursday. no final decision has been taken whether they will be allowed to meet the governor or the cm. justice shamim, it was officially told to the tnn, holds the rank of a union cabinet minister and has quasi-judicial powers to call top dignitaries.",0,0,1,0,0

kolkata: as violence spreads to different parts of the country, minority groups in west bengal are depending on the stateâ€™s long, political tradition of upholding communal amity. ""it is a redeeming feature that fundamentalist groups are not strong in west bengal. due to this, the situation has not gone out of hand in the state,"" jamaat-e-islami hind leader abdul aziz said in kolkata on friday. ""the credit goes to the political awareness of the people and the proactive role of political parties here."" the left front government has always taken prompt administrative steps to control any situation arising from communal tension. unlike gujarat, where the administration has an abysmal record in controlling communal crime, the west bengal government has always been prompt in deploying police and rapid action force. moreover, there is a place for public opinion here in west bengal. this was in evidence when chief minister buddhadeb bhattacharjee was forced to clarify his reported comments on madrasahs harbouring criminals. ""it was because of pressure from the grassroots levels that the chief minister had to retract his comments. the minorities are the main support base of the left front. grassroots level front workers found it essential that the mistrust be cleared up,"" aziz said. minority groups and police officials in some districts have said that undercurrents of tension did exist and steps must be taken to nip it in the bud. ""our delhi office has faxed a statement condemning the godhra incident and demanding an inquiry. we have circulated it,"" aziz said. political leaders have also been playing an active role in promoting tolerance. trinamul con-gress mp sudip bandyopadhyay talked to people in his kolka north west constituency since morning and urged them to maintain peace as there is a large minority concentration in his constituency. trinamul congress minority cell leader sultan ahmed said there were attempts to spread rumours in some minority-dominated areas, but he has asked his party members ""not to fall into any provocation"". land revenue minister rezzak mollah said that all left front mlas have been asked to go to their constituencies and ensure there was no violence. cpm members have been taking out processions in districts and sub-divisional towns since thursday. the need for secular ideals was being upheld in meetings. urdu newspapers published from the city have also taken a balanced view. in its editorials, the dailies have condemned the godhra incident and said that the assembly of kar sevaks in ayodhya should never have been allowed. district authorities have also stepped up vigil.

mumbai: their limbs may be broken but theyâ€™re a determined band. one a paraplegic, another a polio victim, yet another an amputee. coming together under the banner of â€˜apang senaâ€™, this group of 150 disabled persons from navi mumbai is confronting the current communal crisis in a unique way. they have pledged that all the telephone booths manned by the handicapped will intervene in situations if people try to instigate others, will protect victims should the occasion arise, and will use their network to verify and scotch rumours as soon as possible. they will sit at vashi station in their special vehicles carrying peace posters on sunday. â€œwe are proud that in 1992-â€™93 when bombay went up in flames, not a single shop was looted in navi mumbai nor a single person killed, though people of all communities live here,â€™â€™ says pushparaj shetty, a polio victim and an activist with apang sena. in case thereâ€™s trouble we are determined to keep our neighbourhood safe again. we have started making posters which will be put up at our telephone booths and will also bring out a pamphlet on safety measures which will be circulated through the network of our booths. people think the handicapped are weak and pity us but we want to show that we can also do something for society.â€™â€™ disabled persons in navi mumbai felt the need to unionise as they all faced problems regularising the telephone booths they had been allotted. â€œpublic call booths are allotted so close to one another that business gets spread thin,â€™â€™ explains pushparaj. â€œmoreover booths are shifted around at the whims of corporators. no one can survive on an std line alone. if we try to supplement our income by selling cold drinks, biscuits or toiletries, we have to first get municipal permission. this means dealing with mtnl, the municipality and cidco. with the cidco office being located at belapur, our members find it very difficult to go up and down, as for some, the only means of transport is a handoperated cycle.â€™â€™ today apang sena members include the blind, deaf and dumb along with the physically handicapped. some are studying, some employed. not all run telephone booths.as their membership grew they formed the apang cooperative society and applied for housing quarters under the handicapped quota but since they have been allotted land at the impractical location of khargar, six stations away from vashi, their efforts are yet to materialise. kutubbuddin rasool ansari, an active member of apang sena has been paraplegic from i987 when he was injured in police firing during communal riots that erupted after the reliance cup cricket match. after nine years at the sharan paraplegic foundation where he learnt tailoring and cycle repairs he is economically self-reliant but tends to catch infections easily and is under regular treatment at g.t.hospital. â€œhave you seen the photographs of bandaged children in the newspapers?â€™â€™ he asks, referring to the recent carnage at gujarat. â€œwith every riot, the handicapped population increases. we who have suffered will do everything to prevent this. handicapped people have no caste, no community. being handicapped is the common bond.â€™â€™ only one other member of apang sena is a riot victim, most of the others were handicapped after accidents. but they are vocal and unanimous in criticising communal violence.â€œwhat happened at godhra was bad, but what happened in gujarat afterwards is worse,â€™â€™ says ankosh deogarh, who worked as a mechanic at sewree before he lost his legs in a train accident. â€œsuch riots set the country back by ten years. it takes years to start a business, make a life, but minutes to destroy it. whoever kills in the name of religion is neither hindu nor muslim but shaitan ke aulaad.â€™â€™ strong words, but the faces around him nod in assent. â€œi am not a secularist but a hindu. ram is born in our hearts every day,â€™â€™ says shetty who shaved off his beard in 1993 after being accosted by a mob who had burnt alive a man â€œlike a tandoori chickenâ€™â€™ in front of him. â€œtwenty years ago we hadnâ€™t heard of babri masjid or ayodhya. tell leaders to forget mandir-masjid and build a monument to the people who have died. tell them the handicapped people of navi mumbai will donate all our std booths to them if only they let the country live in peace.â€™â€™",0,0,1,0,1

gandhinagar: bjp national president jana krishnamurthy has rejected the strong yearning of the state party leadership for holding early state assembly polls in gujarat, to take advantage of the communal polarisation after the recent riots. he told newspersons, soon after filing his nomination papers for the rajya sabha seat from gujarat, that the bjp would not like to take advantage of the situation. ""the situation does not demand fresh elections, the next assembly polls are scheduled only for february 2003,"" he said. a puzzled chief minister narendra modi sat by quietly, signalling to his party boss from new delhi to restrain himself from making such a statement. but an adamant krishnamurthy made it clear to all those who wanted an early poll that the bjp does not believe in taking advantage of ""such a situation"". he emphasised, ""i detest the very talk about an early poll in gujarat under such circumstances,"" adding, ""we don''t take political mileage from such an eventuality"". saying he did not have enough time to read reports as to in whose favour the popular sentiments have gone after the riots, krishnamurthy emphasised, ""i have visited ahmedabad city. what i can say is the state government''s effort to control the communal riots early should be appreciated. one can only draw a parallel with the 1984 anti-sikh riots in delhi, where more than 3,000 men, women and children had died, and the then prime minister justified it saying when a big tree falls, some commotion was bound to happen."" krishnamurthy said, ""even though all the law and order machinery was readily available then, the riots could not be controlled in delhi. however, here, within 24 hours, the law and order situation had improved."" agreeing that largest number of people had died during the recent riots than anyone that preceded, he added, ""it is, however, not a question of numbers. even if one person dies, it is a sad thing. the state government should now protect the people and ensure that such a thing does not happen in the society again"". referring to the view now widely being taken among large sections of intelligentsia and business circles that the state''s economy has been pushed back because of the communal disturbances, krishnamurthy said, ""gujaratis have enough stamina and resilience to come out of unhappy situations. it has the ability to quickly overcome disasters like drought, earthquake and communal riots. i want peace to return quickly in the state. the state government needs help from every quarter"". saying that rehabilitation should be the first priority for the government and non-government organisations, krishnamurthy said the government''s efforts in controlling the riots and healing the wounds will go a long way in contributing to the party''s electoral success in future. ""in the recent by-polls, we may not have got votes. but we must remember our past experience. we were just two mps in india in 1984 - one each from andhra pradesh and gujarat. today, we are the single largest party in the country,"" he said.",0,0,0,0,0

politicians are to blame for the ever-increasing communalism in india. they seek votes in the name of caste and creed and add fuel to fire by provocative speeches. the two-party system will serve india better. anyone seeking votes in the name of caste or creed should be banned for ever. people should not be asked to identify their caste or religion in any kind of declaration, application and communication. uttam kumar, vasant kunj india can root out communalism only if it is able to root out terrorism. the terrorism which india has been facing for the last so many years is not a â€œnatural terrorismâ€� born out of some injustice, but it is an â€œengineered terrorismâ€� which is targeted many times against one community. the very purpose of terrorists is to create and sustain communalism. it is the sacred duty of the government of the day to protect its citizens from terrorists. second, vote-bank politics of the present-day politicians does not provide any relief to the victims. a victim of communal violence doesnâ€™t need crocodile tears from politicians, but the real love of concerned people and neighbours, and the protective arm of the local administration. over the years, we have forgotten the divine quality of forgiveness. we tend to consider it a sign of weakness, not a sign of strength. we should know that to think of revenge is the first sign of weakness. we should create the feelings of forgiveness among our younger generation. a separate subject of â€˜harmonyâ€™ should be introduced in the primary and secondary classes. ashok gupta, bali nagar the issue of communalism has been present in our society since time immemorial. our country is ruled by politicians who give more importance to temples and mosques than human life. we should be broad in our thoughts and outlook. itâ€™s high time we stopped behaving like the 15th century people while living in the 21st century society. ankur datta, noida. when a person identifies himself too closely with his religion, he always thinks, â€˜â€˜my customs, my religion, my cultureâ€™â€™ are better than otherâ€™s. it is high time our people shifted their focus from personal aggrandisement to the national interest. if a person thrives, he should thank people who made it possible and god. only when people abandon the single-minded pursuit of selfishness and keep the national interest foremost in thier minds, will we be successful in rooting out evils like communalism. who lives if india dies? archana gupta, bali nagar todayâ€™s politicians are myopic in their outlook. they practise politics based on caste and religion. communalism benefits only them, not the common man. put a stop to communal politics. let none be appeased. there should be no reservations in the name of caste or creed. if there is any reservation, let it be for backward regions to help people get basic amenities like food, water, power, transport and education. o.p. verma, rohini humanity is the first religion. ours is a land of gandhi who was the apostle of non-violence. we should practise what he preached. to root out communalism, we should ban all communal organisations such as the vhp, the rss, the shiv sena,and the ali sena. the need of the hour is to teach gandhism and secularism, not saffronise history. every human being has an innate desire to love. but this noble impulse is being stifled by our vile politicians and communal leaders. who is paying the price for their vile schemes: the common hindu and muslim. indiaâ€™s strength lies in unity, humanity, secularism and respect for all religions. mazhab nahi sikhata aapas main bair rakhna. live and let live. mohammed hamid saba, munirka the present crop of our politicians is rooted in vice, caste, communalism, and corruption. communalism is their ladder to political power. why wonâ€™t those who reap harvest by stoking communal fire lose any opportunity to fan it?

kolkata: besides khadim vice-chairman partha roy bur-man, other businessmen of the city, too, were in the list of targets for abduction drawn up by the dubai-based aftab ansari. during interrogations by cid officials, he revealed that he was just waiting for the opportune moment to strike again. after the abduction of roy burman, aftab ansari called up from dubai several top and middle-rung businessmen of kolkata de-manding hefty ransom. this was the candid confession made by aftab to the officers of state criminal investigation department on monday, a day after he was brought to kolkata from rajkot. a cid source said, threatening over the telephone was not exactly his style of action. in such cases, the amount extracted from the victim was far less than what was demanded. but after the high-profile abduction of roy burman, asif reza khan, the key abduc-tor and aftabâ€™s operational head in india, who was later killed in gujarat in an encounter, insisted that aftabâ€™s call would pay rich dividend. cid officers said that like roy burman, the businessmen in his list were well chosen after a lot of researching on them. but ar-rests of his men following the abduction and the release upset his plan to a great extent. aftab looked run down after spending over a month in the custody of different agencies. but during the interrogation he remained uncannily calm and relaxed. â€œbut so far, he has not revealed any-thing which is completely new to us,â€� a cid officer said. cid officers are suspicious about aftabâ€™s apparent â€œco-operativeâ€� approach. earlier, the cid interrogated asif, who also showed a great deal of co-operation. he was taken to park circus, where aftabâ€™s men built a den for keeping in touch with aftab in dubai. yet asif managed to reveal almost nothing about jamaluddin nasser, another key aftab-man and his house in tiljala. nasser at that time sat pretty in his tiljala house.",0,1,1,0,0
480,268,"new delhi: the wave of murders and arson attacks against muslims and their businesses in gujarat is a slap on the face of prime minister vajpayee, whose grossly understated appeal for calm after wednesdayâ€™s dastardly attack on train passengers in godhra has clearly not been heeded by the gujarat government. while the official inquiry will establish the extent to which the attack on the sabarmati express was premeditated, there can be no doubt about the planned nature of the violence directed against gujaratâ€™s muslims on thursday. property worth crores was burned down by well-organised gangs, which went about their business in the knowledge that the police would do nothing. it was perhaps in anticipation of such a development that vajpayee cancelled his visit to australia. intimately familiar with gujarat cm narendra modiâ€™s reputation as a hardliner within the hindutva parivar, the pm knew he could not be counted upon to act as an efficient â€” let alone even-handed â€” administrator at a time like this. indeed, alarming signs were visible soon after wednesdayâ€™s carnage, when the pronouncements of senior gujarat ministers suggested restraint was the last thing on their minds. tragically, vajpayee has overestimated his capacity to enforce peace through verbal appeals and physical presence alone. he has failed to realise that he does not have the moral clout of mahatma gandhi â€” and that only the exercise of the political and administrative powers he possesses can ensure that gujarat does not burn. when the vhp gave a call for a gujarat-wide bandh, both vajpayee and union home minister l k advani should have realised the incendiary implications. two years ago â€” in august 2000 â€” when the vhp gave a similar call after the killing of pilgrims in pahalgam in kashmir, sangh parivar activists torched muslim property worth crores in ahmedabad, surat, sabarkantha, palanpur and rajkot. in surat alone, muslim powerloom owners lost property worth rs 10 crore. unlike the august 2000 vhp bandh, the gujarat government this time did not formally endorse the extremist outfitâ€™s call. but the manner in which the state administration has facilitated â€” through omission and, possibly, commission â€” the anti-muslim violence of the vhp and bajrang dal activists makes the modi administration equally culpable. the physical targeting of muslims and their businesses by the sangh parivar is likely to have disastrous consequences for the country. with the vhp and kindred groups like the shiv sena anxious to milk the situation, violence can spread to other parts of the country. at a time when muslim indians are already feeling alienated and victimised, the carnage in gujarat will drive them to the wall.

mumbai: following its debacle in the recently concluded zilla parishad polls, the congress-led democratic front government seems to be losing its political will to push through a scheme to reform the milk purchase scheme in the state. for the second time now, the state government has decided to put on hold its decision to ask milk cooperatives to sell at least 20 per cent of their milk collection locally.the decision, taken last year, was to be put into effect from january 1 this year.it was then postponed to march 1. now, says dairy development commissioner, m. rameshkumar, the government has decided to give some more time to the milk cooperatives till may 1.â€œthe milk cooperatives have made representations to say that they need time to put the infrastructure in place to sell milk in thier areas,â€™â€™ he said. according to sources, the government has developed cold feet following the congressâ€™ poor showing at the polls. it does not want to antagonise the milk producers any further for fear of losing a votebank. also, cooperatives in the state form a powerful political lobby, who have been asserting their say in their own governance. maharashtra is probably the only state where the government plays an active role in the dairy sector. as of now, the government is committed to purchasing all the milk that is sold to it by the cooperative unions. it buys 16.5 lakh litres of milk every day from about 65 unions, which causes a loss of about rs 200 crore per year. about 4.5 lakh litres of milk procured daily is surplus, and is converted into butter and milk powder. the conversion costs a total loss of rs 5 per litre. for 2001-02, the government has produced 17,000 tonnes of powder and 13,000 tonnes of butter, of which about 3,000 tonnes in each case remains unsold. â€œthis vast stock ends up depressing the market, driving the government further into the red,â€™â€™ observes an official. dairy experts say there is simply no escape from encouraging local consumption of milk since exports from the country are too low today at 0.1 per cent to make much of a difference if they are increased. â€œexports cannot grow exponentially but local sales can,â€™â€™ says an expert. the co-operative model in maharashtra does not work the same way as that in gujarat.while the gujarat cooperatives have grouped themselves under amul, which is manned entirely by milk producers, cooperatives in maharashtra are controlled by politicians.â€œ their politicisation has weakened their performance; there is lack of accountability, and absence of a vision for growth,â€™â€™ says an analyst. this in turn affects the well-being of the farmer. though a producer gets a higher price in maharashtra than he does in gujarat, he receives no benefits from his cooperative. in the amul model, the farmer gets a share in all the profits made through sales and investments by the company.while a gujarat milk producer gets rs 8.18 per litre on an average from the cooperative, a milk producer in maharashtra gets an average of rs 9 per litre. further, the average cost of handling is higher here. in gujarat, it is about 75 paise per litre and in maharashtra, it is about rs 1.15 per litre.",0,0,0,0,0
483,578,"new delhi: up governor vishnu kant shastri''s advice to the centre to bring the state under president''s rule can be challenged in the court of law in the wake of suprerme court''s verdict in bommai case, noted lawyer and mp fali s nariman has opined. according to legal experts, the governor has opened the door for litigations by not inviting the single largest party after the assembly elections to form the government. nariman says, ""proclamation itself can be challenged on limited grounds as enunciated by the sc''s judgement in the bommai case."" what can be these grounds which hold true in up''s case? jitendra sharma, senior lawyer at the supreme court, explains: ""malafide is a ground for judicial interference, according to the bommai judgment which strictly applies in uttar pradesh."" ""in up"", sharma says, ""the governor has taken a partisan position. he should have gone for floor test which is the best test to ascertain if a party enjoys majority in the legislative assembly or not."" in this case, he says, leader of the largest party wanted the opportunity to prove his majority, which was denied to him. sharma cites two instances when leader of the single largest party not enjoying clear majority was invited to form the government. vajpayee in 1996 and earlier rajiv gandhi in 1989. while vajpayee''s government lasted for 13 days, gandhi declined to form the government. without getting into the legal question, former up governor romesh bhandari says shastri had no option. but he raises another point: ""there is a critical situation in ayodhya, which needs to be handled. there is a apprehension of linkage between the bjp and the vhp. so, it would have been prudent on the part of the governor to invite the single largest party to form the government and prove its majority on the floor of the assembly."" however, bhandari says, president''s rule will not affect the presidential election. ""the new assembly may not have been constituted yet, but it has been notified,"" he says and gives the 1996 example when mlas voted for rajya sabha elections during the president''s rule. ""only the term of assembly will get affected. it will begin from the day the assembly is convened,"" he explains.

mumbai: a cross-section of citizens has expressed concern over the build-up of events relating to ayodhya and the violence following the incident at godhra. â€œmany indians are feeling insecure in their own country because they are expecting a repeat of the communal frenzy that gripped the country after the demolition of the babri masjid,â€™â€™ said former congress mla chandrashekar prabhu. kisan mehta of the save bombay committee felt that the events were a threat to the unity and integrity of india. â€œsupporting fundamentalists is dangerous anywhere, specially in india which has so many disparities,â€™â€™ he said, adding that the present picture was very dismal. activist teesta setalvad felt that the supreme court ought to take an initiative to prevent a repeat of 1992. intellectuals had appealed to the then chief justice, m.n.venkatachaliah, who only appointed an observer. â€œalready 75,000 people have gathered at ayodhya and given the anger sparked by the godhra incident, anything can happen,â€™â€™ she said. â€œwhat shocks me is the cynicism with which some politicians are stoking communal passions,â€™â€™ said gerson da cunha of agni. when the rest of the world is moving ahead, we are sliding back to medieval times, he lamented. ajay kaul, school principal and a member of a mohalla committee, felt that intellectuals from both communities ought to come together to resolve the issue since politicians have lost credibility. lawyer yusuf muchchala felt that the assurance given by prime minister a.b. vajpayee that the status quo would be maintained at the disputed site could not be taken at face value as the government was doing nothing to stop thousands of kar sevaks from pouring into ayodhya. â€œin 1992, neither the government nor the bjp leaders could control the mob,â€™â€™ he said. according to him, it was up to the bjpâ€™s partners in the nda to restrain it and ensure that secularism was upheld. meanwhile, several intellectuals issued a joint statement appealing to secular forces to exert pressure on the vajpayee government to stop the congregation of kar sevaks at ayodhya. they said, â€œthe threat held out by the vishwa hindu parishad (vhp) to start the construction of ram mandir on march 15 at the site of the demolished babri masjid, in utter disregard of the already initiated judicial process, is reminiscent of the fascist tactics that led to the shameful vandalism of december 6, 1992. â€œfollowing a nationwide ram japa yatra the vhp is now bringing lakhs of kar sevaks at ayodhya to effect the construction of the temple to be put together from the materials already assembled near the proposed site in complicity with a plaint administration. just as at the time of demolition of the mosque, the sangh parivar is going to present a fait accompli once again before the nation,â€™â€™ they warned. the signatories include mahesh bhatt, vivan sundaram, irfan habib, shyam benegal, saeed mirza, k.n. panikkar and kamleshwar.

pathankot: several school teachers had to face embarrassment and humiliation at the hands of college principals who did not allow them to join duty for the plus two examination in colleges on wednesday, despite the punjab school education board authorisation letters. the school teachers said they were made to suffer due to the confusion caused by two notices issued by the state education board.talking to the tnn, dr didar singh, a lecturer at senior secondary school, lamini (pathankot), said the principal of ab college, pathankot, did not allow him to join his duty as examination superintendent at the college centre despite the authorisation letter issued by the school board authorities.he alleged that the principal did not consult the board authorities and humiliated him by debarring him from joining duty. he said while many of the school teachers who were assigned examination duties at the college centres had joined their duties on wednesday, the ab. college principal acted in an unlawful manner to encourage â€œcheatingâ€�. when contacted, the ab college principal, swatantar murgai, said, â€œi did not allow didar singh to join his duty at the college centre as the state school education board had rescinded its earlier circular vide letter 42442â€”-592 dated january 8, 2002, which stated that the school lecturers may be debarred from joining their duties in colleges following a complaint by the college teachers union. he said that didar singhâ€™s was not the only case. school teachers all over the state were disallowed from joining their duties by the college authorities. he said the college principals were compelled by the college teachers, who had complained to them that they would not work under the school teachers during examination duty. since objections were raised against the school teachers joining examination duties in colleges, the principal of a college was given powers to debar them from joining their duties. dr didar singh, however, wondered which order of the school examination board authorities was valid . while murgai was quoting the order of the concerned authorities dated january 8, he had received his letter directing him to function as examination superintendent at the college dated february 12, 2002. vhp unit to send jatha: undeterred by the government plea, the gurdaspur unit of the vhp said on wednesday it would send a jatha of 50 kar sevaks to ayodhya for ram temple construction on march 16, 2002. in a statement, the president of the gurdaspur vhp unit, subhash malguria, said the jatha of kar sevaks carrying tridents will include vhp, among other bodies.",0,0,0,0,0

""interest accrued on the sum is used for the maintenance of the vhp office here,"" the sadhu said. with two attendents at his service, chaitanya maharaj does not fail to have a look at the bricks on a daily basis and ensure these are cleaned every week to preserve their shine. however, about 200 bricks have been broken by monkeys which roam about freely in his compound, he said. ask him about when he thinks these will be brought into use, he says, ""there is no worry as these will be preserved for quite some time and used whenever the issue is resolved.""

ahmedabad: the traditional trouble spots of disturbances in the walled city area of ahmedabad are surprisingly quiet as the fringes of the city are emerging as the new communal hot-spots. it is remarkable, police officials say, that thickly-populated areas like kalupur, dariapur, jamalpur and raipur and khadia have remained relatively trouble-free this time accounting for only 6 out of a over 300 deaths that have taken place in ahmedabad over the last four days. the bulk of the killings have taken place in meghaninagar, naroda, odhav, amraiwadi and gomtipur. and the reasons are not far to seek. while the communally-volatile walled city areas have sizeable population of both the communities sharing space, there is also mutual respect for each others'' strengths, than in areas where one or the other community is hopelessly outnumbered and targeting them was easy for the mobs. surprisingly, even as pitched battles were on in fringe areas of gomtipur and naroda, the womenfolk were busy buying vegetables and fruits in manek chowk in the hub of the city. for the first time perhaps in the history of communal flare-ups of ahmedabad, it is not the walled city areas which are in the news for all the wrong reasons. officials say it could also be ''riot fatigue'' as the residents of the walled city have suffered the worst consequences of riots and therefore they have preferred to remain away from perpetuation of violence. when commissioner of police p c pandey was asked for his reaction on the phenomenon, he quipped, ""thank god that the walled city remained quiet this time."" he admitted that the situation would have taken a serious turn had trouble sparked off inside the walled city. in 1969, 1983, 1985 and 1992 the focus of attention were areas like kalupur, dariapur, jamalpur and the worst-hit raipur and khadia, which have earned the dubious distinction for violence since british days. the bouts of communal orgy in ahmedabad has its roots in the local problem of rath yatra taken out from the famous jagdish temple in jamalpur area of the walled city. the first major disturbance was reported in 1946 when ugly clashes took place between two communities when the rath yatra was passing through sensitive areas. according to sources, the large-scale communal riots had started following tiffs over annual the rath yatra procession only, except in 1992 when trouble erupted after the demolition of the babri mosque. and this is perhaps for the second time that riots were triggered off during the gujarat bandh call by vishva hindu parishad to protest against the killing of ram sevaks aboard sabarmati express while returning from ayodhya. unfortunately, despite frequent communal riots the state administration has not bothered to implement the recommendations made by two inquiry commissions, one appointed after the 1969 riots and then after the 1985 riots. the reports submitted by the reddy and dave commissions have been shelved and none of their findings and suggestions have been accepted or implemented so far. ""neither the congress nor the bjp regime have taken pains to study the recommendations made by these commissions to check the communal disturbances in ahmedabad,"" a senior minister said on condition of anonymity.",0,0,1,1,0

""several teams of local vhp activists and sympathisers have been formed to perform the task of hiding these kar sevaks,"" the sources said. these teams are also told to help kar sevaks infiltrate into ayodhya avoiding police, they said. many are stationed in neighbouring districts waiting for the right opportunity to enter ayodhya.

lucknow: while fully justifying imposition of the presidentâ€™s rule in uttar pradesh, lok jana shakti (ljp) chief and union coal minister ram vilas paswan on friday made it clear to governor vishnukant shastri that his partyâ€™s two mlas would support only a government headed by rajnath singh and nobody else. paswan also a gave a letter to this effect to the governor here and told him in his brief meeting that his party would not support either the bsp or samajwadi party government. although paswanâ€™s two mlas are not of much help, his open support to rajnath singh is considered politically significant. this is because paswan is a partner in the nda in new delhi and his posture may bring some relief to rajnath singh, who appears to be a lone voice within the bjp to question its support to the bsp. talking to newsmen, paswan, however, said that his partyâ€™s stand was very clear in support of rajnath singh right from the beginning and there could not be any going back from it. he, however, expressed his unhappiness with the bjp, which he said would have fared well, if it had contested the assembly elections in coordination with the ljp. when asked how rajnath singh could form the government in up without the requisite number, he said: â€œi donâ€™t know that. to us, there was nothing wrong if he formed the government with the support of the bsp. but in no case we would support the bsp government headed by mayawati with the support of the bjp.â€� in reply to another question, he said the ljp had no reservation if the bsp joined the nda. but then, he quickly added, that this was only a figment of imagination at this state and i can not comment on it at this juncture.â€� while welcoming the vhp for its announcement to abide by the courtâ€™s decision on the disputed site in ayodhya, he said had it been announced earlier, it would have helped the bjp in the elections. the ljp, he said, had lost at least from 11 seats due to unfriendly posture of the bjp and added that the two could have done well, if joined hands together. what was required was the common manifesto of the nda for the elections and selection of candidates jointly by its all partners in up. in the absence of it, he said both the bjp and other nda partners had faced the debacle in the elections. reiterating that the ljp would contest any elections in the state hereafter alone, he said: â€œour voters, particularly dalits, are very annoyed at the treatment given to the party by the nda and there was no reason seen to contest the future elections under its bannerâ€�. giving examples of the partyâ€™s performance in the assembly elections, he said that on the 18 seats where party candidates had been fielded, they performed well on some seats and got more votes than the candidates of the nda partners. he said that the ljp would now concentrate more in up and added that the party had decided to launch month-long statewide membership drive from july 1.",0,0,0,0,0

ahmedabad: besides being the birthplace of the zealot mughal emperor aurangzeb, the twin towns of dahod and godhra have always been known for the religious divide that runs deep between communities and even within them. and had the police taken serious note of a clash between groups of muslims in dahod''s neighbouring town in december 2001, perhaps it would not have been caught totally unawares by wednesday''s macabre attack on the sabarmati express. while godhra has always been a flash-point of clashes between hindus and muslims, it is also witnessing an intensive struggle for supremacy between radical and moderate sections of the muslim community. in early december, followers of the moderate ahil-e-sunnat, an offspring of the barelvi islamic school, clashed with members of the radical tableeq jamaat after their differences over islamic tenets came to a boil. the rioting led to a lot of violence in which some shops and vehicles belonging to both the groups were torched. a dozen persons from both the sides were injured as the groups clashed with lathis and swords and pelted stones on each other for almost two hours before the police burst tear-gas shells to disperse the mob. the police arrested 72 persons from both the groups after they registered complaints of loot and plunder against each other. the incident followed a month after the local police warned a group of muslim boys belonging to tableeq jamaat against dressing themselves like osama bin laden. the problem started when two tableeq jamaat preachers from kashmir landed up at the noor mosque of the sunnat and started collecting donations during the month of ramzaan. the actual clash began when the duo insisted that they would sleep at the mosque against the instructions of the sunnat. in its seven mosques in dahod, a town of 1.20 lakh population, the sunnat has put up boards saying: ""outsiders shouldn''t come to the mosque. delivering provocative speeches is strictly prohibited."" the sunnat was forced to put up the instruction after it found that the tableeq preachers from outside dahod were coming to the sunnat mosques and delivering provocative speeches based on radical interpretation of islam and trying to hijack the sunnat followers to the tableeq fold. the barelvi school, from which the sunnat has sprung, has always stood for dargah worship and urs celebrations (fetes in memory of sufi saints), thus believing in the spiritualism of muslim saints. while the tableeqis, who are for puritanical salafi brand of islam, equate dargah worship with idol worship. sunnat leaders, some of whom are familiar faces during hindu religious festivals in dahod, say the tableeqis spread hatred in the society through their ideology. osama bin laden is a hero for them. in mid-2001, tableeqis disturbed a moharram procession. the stand-off between the two groups began in 1981 when the tableeqis objected to the sunnat maulvi reading the annual id namaaz at the local idgah. but the sunnat spurned the tableeqis. as a result, the local collector stepped in and took control of the idgah. since that day the idgah is locked, a tribute to the rivalry between the two groups. interestingly, the two outside tableeqi activists, who, according to the sunnat, were kashmiris, fled the town as soon as trouble began in december. police now believe that they were probably isi agents and there could be more of them still around. the attack on sabarmati express, it is now learnt, originated from a rumour in dahod that the passengers had attacked a mosque. by the time the train reached godhra, 40 minutes away, the mob was ready to pounce on the train. needless to say, there is a very large section of the minority community in godhra and other parts of gujarat who would be as upset with the attack on the train as the vhp volunteers.",0,1,1,1,1

varanasi: founder trustee of the ramalaya trust jagadguru ramanandacharya swami ramnareshacharya has questioned the authority of the shankaracharya of kanchi kamakoti jayendra saraswati in mediating the temple issue among the union government, vishwa hindu parishad (vhp) and muslim organisations. talking to times news network here on monday, swami ramnareshacharya said that the shankaracharya was not recognised by the pithadheesh of four peeths of hindus and added that jayendra saraswati and ashok singhal were the two sides of the same coin. the seer, who hogged the limelight by holding religious programmes in the name of jagadguru ramanandacharya and who is stated to be close to congress president sonia gandhi, said that even the court verdict could not satisfy both the communities. thus, efforts should be made to convince the muslims that an early solution to the ayodhya issue would be in their own interest, he added. claiming that the vhp did not enjoy support of the seer community, swami ramnareshacharya regretted that the government was treating the vhp as the sole representative of the hindu community and was not interested in consulting seers who were against the parishadâ€™s ideology. he added that â€œit is not correct that the ramalaya trust is trying to create division among seers.â€� jagadguru shankaracharya swami swaroopanand saraswati and other seers were also interested in the construction of ram temple. â€œbut we have distanced ourselves from the purnahuti yagya as the vhp leaders have made a history-sheeter the chairman of ram janmabhumi trust,â€� he added. refuting the charges that he and swami swaroopanand were working for the congress, he said that though the allegation had no basis but even if it was true then did it mean that they should not be consulted by the union government?",0,0,0,0,0

lucknow: cancellation and diversion of 19 trains to the twin cities of faizabad and ayodhya following the macabre incident at godhra in gujarat last week and the subsequent build-up of â€˜ram sewaksâ€™ in ayodhya has hit the northern railway revenue considerably. loss of revenue is not the only factor worrying nr officials, but the fear of checking staff being attacked by mobs is causing them some concern. the home ministry has sent a word of caution to the ayodhya division which is being taken seriously considering the developing situation. since the nr staff was intercepting movement of the â€˜ram sewaksâ€™, the faxed message goes on to say, the check on ticketless travel and other prohibitory measures involved is fraught with dangers and hence has advised the nr top brass â€œto be adequately supported by state police contingentsâ€�. similar messages have also been sent to the chairman railway board, principal secretary (home) and the commissioner faizabad to ensure proper security to the railway officials and property. all law enforcement agencies have also been asked to be on vigil. as for the revenue part, in the last four days alone the nr has lost more than rs 37 lakh owing to bulk cancellation of tickets on trains like sabarmati express, sealdah-jammu tawi express, the lokmanya tilak saket express, the faizabad-allahabad saryu express and the mankapur-katra express. on sunday alone 1947 passengers cancelled their tickets and nr refunded rs 5.73 lakh to them. senior dcm (nr) km tripathi confirmed of cancellations from stations like varanasi, faizabad, sultanpur, barabanki, rudauli, akbarpur, malepur, shahganj and lucknow. bk maurya, sp (grp) also concedes that tough measures initiated by them had acted as a deterrent enough for â€˜ram sewaksâ€™ and there was some decline in passenger travel. the orders to prevent ram sewaks from entering the temple town, officials say, have even kept ordinary passengers away. in the last one week alone since the godhra incident there has been a 30 per cent reduction in the number of passengers using train, says an official. it is also due to the strict ticket checking in the region. about 2500 inspectors have been deployed to check ticketless travel.",0,0,1,0,0

524,613,"ahmedabad: giving a clean chit to gujarat government, home minister l k advani on sunday rejected the demand for handing over the state''s commercial capital to the army as three days of communal frenzy showed signs of abating except stray arson, looting and police firing. advani also denied that the police played a passive role in the communal riots in ahmedabad and other places since they had resorted to effective firing to check the violence that had erupted in the wake of an attack on the sabarmati express in godhra last wednesday.

the army was also rushed in the next 24 hours to assist the local administration. referring to the opposition demand that the state should be handed over to the army, he said it was an irresponsible statement particularly when the army has been positioned to protect the borders.

addressing a crowded news conference after his visit to the scene of the railway tragedy in godhra as well as violence-affected areas of ahmedabad, advani said 77 deaths due to police firing had been reported from several parts of the state so far.

advani joined prime minister atal behari vajpayee in condemning communal violence and said: ``it was definitely a blot on the nation.'''' the communal flare-up in gujarat spoilt the good track record of the coalition government at the centre, he said.

asked whether the godhra train tragedy was premeditated, he said: ``it seemed premeditated.'''' as per his information based on a visit to the godhra railway station and discussions with the officials, ``it was certain that there were some other elements behind the incident''''.

the state government has already ordered a judicial probe to ascertain the facts of the gruesome incident and therefore it was not proper for him to comment on whether anti-national elements were involved in it, he added.

he said state officials had told him in godhra that at least four councillors of the godhra municipality had been arrested along with some 80 persons in connection with the attack on the sabarmati express. he was not aware of their party affiliations, he said adding that the inquiry report would reveal the truth.

he, however, maintained that the godhra incident and the riots should not be linked.

chief minister narendra modi, who was also present, said the state government would consider conducting an inquiry into the communal riots in various parts of gujarat.

the union home minister condemned the incidents in ahmedabad, including the one in which former congress mp ehsaan jaffri and his family members were killed. ``this kind of communal violence would send out wrong signals when concerted efforts were being made to crush terrorism from across the border and other parts of the world,'''' he said.

he said the law and order situation had improved after the deployment of the army and expressed the confidence that both the army and police would help restore normalcy.

he also said that the state government had assured him that the administration would make all-out efforts not only to restore peace but protect each and every citizen irrespective of his caste or creed and also deal firmly with the ongoing communal frenzy.

the people should extend support to the massive efforts being made by the government in this direction. local peace committees should organise meetings to restore order and communal harmony in the violence-affected areas.

patna: union power minister suresh p prabhu threatened to stop central assistance to states failing to revamp and restructure their electricity boards as part of nationwide reforms in the power sector. speaking to mediapersons on friday, after winding up his dayâ€™s tour to bihar, prabhu said that most of the states, including bihar, had signed a memorandum of understanding (mou) for trifurcating their respective electricity boards for improving the generation, transmission and distribution systems. â€œreforms in the power sector has become the need of hour and each state will have to come forward to revamp their electricity boards and if they fail to rise to the occasion to reform the power sector, the centre will have no option, but to stop assistance to their respective boards,â€� prabhu said. prabhu said that all the electricity boards will have to become commercially viable as they have suffered huge loss to the tune of over rs 40,000 crore in the last several years. and over rs 20,000 crore were going down the drains due to power theft, he said and added that various measures are on the cards to revamp the power sector for making it commercially viable. he said that the centre is ready to provide assistance to the bihar state electricity board (bseb) for making it commercially viable. state power minister shakeel ahmed khan said that the bihar government has already signed a mou for trifurcation of the bseb and steps were being taken in this regard. prabhu laid the foundation stone for the construction of 220 kv d\c sasaram-arrah-khagaul transmission line at khagaul and 220\132 kv sub-station at ara to provide power supply to the city of patna and eastern parts of bihar by the powergrid corporation of india. powergrid chairman r p singh, who was also present on the occasion, said that the corporation had initiated various measures to modernise the transmission line throughout the country. for providing stable power supply in bihar, a project has been launched by the powergrid to commission a â€œpower ringâ€� within bihar connecting purnia, muzaffarpur, biharsharif, sasaram and patna, singh said. prabhu said that the union ministry of power has also launched an accelerated power development programme (ardp) under the auspices of the powergrid in bihar, uttar pradesh, maharashtra, gujarat and goa for improvement and strengthening of the transmission and distribution network. under the programme, kankarbagh in patna and areas of muzaffarpur have been selected by the powergrid. the powergrid will assist the bseb for energy auditing and accounting mainly to improve the electricity distribution in three circles of the bseb â€” pesu east, patna and muzaffarpur.",0,0,0,0,0

532,638,"journalists constantly wring their hands over the growing criminalisation of politics, and call on political parties to choose better candidates. such moral lecturing is vacuous. criminals are not entering politics because of some inexplicable moral lapse by candidate selection committees, but because they have huge incentives to get in. to get them out, we must change the incentive system. many laws need changing, but one single change can have a huge impact. let the law provide that criminal cases against legislators will be heard before all others on a day-by-day basis to ensure a quick verdict. in one stroke, that will create a huge disincentive for criminals to contest elections. many will resign from the legislatures to escape the consequences. today, criminals join politics to gain influence and ensure that cases against them are dropped or not proceeded with. the law disqualifies convicted criminals from fighting elections. but this does not keep criminals out of politics because legal delays, often abetted by political pressures, make convictions of resourceful crooks rather rare. criminals threaten witnesses with death, and the feeble state cannot protect them. so we need a radical change. i wonder why public pressure for such change is not greater. our standards have dropped so far that we no longer realise how outrageous our situation is by international standards. when i tell foreigners that our legislatures are full of bandits, they smile incredulously. surely you mean, they say, that bandits assist your legislators? no, i insist, the bandits are the legislators. at which point the foreigners look appalled and foxed: they cannot understand how this can be so in what claims to be the worldâ€™s biggest democracy. a casual look at last weekâ€™s events shows how commonplace is the mixing of crime and politics. exhibit 1: the gujarat police say the man behind the godhra massacre was a local muslim politician, a feared don. exhibit 2: mansoor ahmed, samajwadi party mla, was shot at a public meeting. his family says the killing was staged by a political rival, tanveer ahmed, who was denied the samajwadi ticket and so contested, unsuccessfully, on the bsp ticket. gang killings and political killings are becoming indistinguishable. exhibit 3: ram sewak gautam, a policeman who had the temerity to raid the premises of don-cum-politician dp yadav and track down his son vikasâ€”who is accused of murderâ€”was transferred in the middle of the murder case. most newspapers ignored this. it is no longer news that officials seeking to catch political criminals get sidelined. look further beyond last week to the up assembly elections. according to india today, 965 of the 5,539 candidates who contested the up elections had criminal records. that is a whopping 17 per cent of all candidates. why are political parties so happy to adopt criminals as candidates? to understand the answer, recall max weberâ€™s definition of the state as the only entity that can use force with impunity. the rule of law is supposed to ensure that anybody else who uses force is jailed. but in india, a weak police and legal system ensures that mafia dons get away with murder. they can use force with impunity. so, a la weber, the mafia have as much legitimacy, in practice if not in theory, as the state. a criminal who can collect protection money is as powerful as an official tax-collector. a don who can use force to settle disputes is actually superior to the state, which is unable to settle disputes because of legal delays. a criminal candidate who can capture and stuff ballot boxes is, in our twisted democracy, on par with a popular politician who wins every vote. normally officials will report booth capturing, but not if the capturing don can credibly threaten them with death. besides, dons have lots of money, which is very useful for fighting expensive election campaigns. india has no system of public funding to enable honest people to meet election costs. black money is needed in hoards, and here criminals have a huge comparative advantage. in the up election, mayawati auctioned several candidatures to the highest bidder. so, according to reports, did the samajwadi party. obviously, criminals will get the better of honest folk in such auctions. why do dons invest large sums in getting tickets? because a ticket to the assembly is a ticket to kickbacks and extortion using political power. since the legal system no longer penalises theft, politicians who steal have a comparative advantage over others. returns on political investments are so high that criminals are disinclined to invest in tax-free rbi bonds. politics is so much more profitable, and just as tax-free. so, our system has unwittingly created huge incentives for criminals to enter politics. in the long run, we must clean up the legal and police system. meanwhile, we need quick steps to change the incentive structure. one is to provide public funding for elections. that will reduce the comparative advantage of criminals, and increase that of honest candidates. the second is to have a blanket ban on defections, a major source of political profit. any legislator who defects or disobeys the party whip in a vote of confidence should be forced to go back to voters for election on a new election symbol. those who split a party should go back to voters too. that will restore some meaning to representative government. but the most far-reaching measure, surely, will be to give automatic seniority to cases against legislators, which should be heard on a day-by-day basis. atal behari vajpayee, you need to find a new way of reviving the sagging fortunes of your party. why not try to seize the high moral ground by introducing a bill to prosecute criminal legislators quickly? your law minister, arun jaitley, will surely comply. true, such a law will be dismaying for mafia dons in your own party. but other parties have even more of them, and will suffer even more. what are you waiting for?

vadodara: if the september 11 attacks last year induced the fear of flying among passengers in the us, the recent burning of the sabarmati express at godhra has done just the reverse in gujarat. travel agencies and airlines'' offices here report a distinct shift in people''s preference from the railways to airlines, say travel agencies and airlines. in the past week, travel agents have cancelled several train bookings and got them booked on airlines, which seems to have become the favoured mode of travel under prevailing circumstances. while the travel trade, at large, has been affected by the riots, the airlines industry is booming with business. says purvi thakar, a travel consultant at karlson wagonlit, ""in the first few days after the sabarmati express attack, several bookings were postponed. but now, we are operating at full capacity with our clients demanding to be rebooked as soon as possible, and most are demanding to be booked on airlines."" according to neha buch, a customer service agent at jet airways, the last few days have seen a steep rise in bookings. ""people seem to be feeling insecure to travel by train and we are flooded with booking orders. currently, all flights are choc-a-bloc and we are working 15 hours a day trying to meet this rush,"" she says. ""even businessmen from anand and halol, who have to catch international flights from mumbai and new delhi, prefer flying to trains."" people from the trade also say that personal travel plans have been shelved and clients are hesitant to move out of the city, unless mandatory. says jayendrasinh jhala of transline tours & travels: ""there has been a 60 to 70 per cent drop in bookings. even short distance travel plans are being cancelled. on the upside, however, there has been a 25 per cent rise in air bookings in the past four days. almost all flights are packed."" one of the reasons for flights being completely full is that executives leaving city on deputation or to attend conferences can''t delay their plans any further. goraiswamy gopinathan, managing director at narmada travels, agrees that there has been an almost 30 per cent rise in air ticketing. ""this is because people are still afraid of night journeys in trains, as the situation is volatile,"" he says. ""but this is only a temporary phase. in a few days rail travel is likely to pick up and be at par."" but some feel that this is only a temporary phase. president of travel agents federation of india (tfai) gujarat chapter, bharat shah, however, says that the rush was felt only in the first few days and there is no specific inclination to air travel, any more. ""it was only a reaction to the riots. the travel patterns are more or less the usual,"" he says. helping air travel in the region is the presence of the golden corridor, that network of small towns around vadodara with their bustling industrial activity. these factories and engineering sheds can''t afford to remain shut for more than a couple of days, especially in these recession-hit days.",0,0,0,0,0

mumbai: to the cynical eye, it seems like a careful-ly choreographed moment from a film on communal harmony. enveloped in a beige burkha, afsaar jaan sits on the church pew clutching a drowsy toddler. her neighbour shanta shinde waits expectantly for the service to begin, while at the other end of the wooden bench, maria pereira pores over a tiny prayer book. the harmonium emits a warning croak, the crowded church gets onto its feet and launches into a melodious hindi hymn, â€œhey, pavitra aasman..â€™â€™ for a country struggling to emerge from a shrieking, blood-splattered nightmare, this may sound like sugary, futile fiction. but this scene is replayed week after week, not in technicolor but in sweaty, frayed reality. every wednesday, come hartal or high water, thou-sands of mumbaikars throng the church of st michael to attend the novena dedicated to mother mary. from cuffe parade housewives who step out of chauffeur-driven cars to pavement-dwellers who straggle in with a brood of children, from brisk parsi matrons bearing armloads of candles to young colle-gians with that mandatory red tint in their hair, many mumbaikars converge in the nave of this bright, white church. â€œiâ€™ve been coming here for three years because it gives me shanti,â€™â€™ says shashi, an engineer with the thane fire brigade, whotakes off for half a day every wednesday to attend the ceremony. adds shanta shinde, a book-binder from kurla who has worked out a similar arrangement with her office, â€œif you come here on nine consecutive wednesdays, your wish is granted. it must be working. why else would lakhs of people return week after week?â€™â€™ this reasoning is enough to fill a procession of 4 ltds and borivli slows, to yank people from as far away as bhayander and kalyan. indeed, bus conduc-tors and cabbies have long grasped that if itâ€™s wednesday, it must be mahim. as, of course, have canny street vendors. the approach to the abode of â€˜mahim mataâ€™ is a vibrancy of crimson lingerie and clothes pegs, a cho-rus of â€œside-sideâ€™â€™ and â€œraste ka maal saste mein.â€™â€™ â€œmumbai mixes and matches everything. so, why should you be surprised if most of the worshippers here are hindus and muslims?â€™â€™ demands shyam sahni, who sells ringletted wigs. agrees tyeb mohammed, a toy vendor who has been part of this ever-expanding street market for the last two decades, â€œthousands of people come hereâ€” tamilians, malabaris, punjabis. this is a good place to do business.â€™â€™ nearer the church, the temporal toys and tooth-brushes make gradual way for sacred objects. some stalls display glow-in-the-dark posters of saints, oth-ers are piled high with marigold garlands, while the candle shops flaunt waxen ware eerie enough to have been sourced from a transylvanian crypt. the grotesque dolls, amputated limbs and snarling den-ture candles, however, comprise a sort of divine code language. â€œbody parts are for health,â€™â€™ explains joan misquitta who, for the last 25 years, has been dealing in waxen bosoms and miniature houses. â€œmeans if you have a leg problem, you must offer a leg candle in the church. if you want a house, you must offer a house candle.â€™â€™ armed with candles, garlands and prayers, thou-sands of worshippers stream into the crowded church between dawn and midnight. they join in the hymns, heed the homily and listen to the petitions and thanksgivings: â€œwe pray for a child to recover from high fever, for peace in gujarat, for a son to get a job,â€™â€™ announces the preacher at each of the 13 wednesday services. â€œwe give thanks for the complete cure of body pain, the gift of peace in our city, the completion of a court case, cooperation from the bmc.â€™â€™ â€œpeople write down their petitions and thanksgiv-ings and put them into a box. the heap is sorted out and about 15 are chosen for the service,â€™â€™ explains fr joe dâ€™abreo. â€œthings are very different today from the humble manner in which the novenas began about 50 years ago.â€™â€™ st michaelâ€™s at mahim was the first church erected by the portuguese in the city. many centuries later, during a trip to ireland, fr eddie fernandes noticed the affection that the people of belfast had for a pic-ture of our lady of perpetual succour. he brought a copy back to mumbai and on september 8, 1948â€” the birthday of mother mary, which happened to fall on a wednesdayâ€”he held a modest novena service. â€œthose early services were attended by a few hun-dred people,â€™â€™ recalls marshall fernandes, a parish-ioner who runs a religious trinketsâ€™ stall near the church. â€œbut the crowds soon grew so large that st michaelâ€™s schoolâ€”where i was a studentâ€”was forced to change the weekly holiday from thursday to wednesday.â€™â€™ what transformed those quiet devotions into this massive mela? â€œitâ€™s said that a prominent hindu gen-tleman who wanted a son made an offering at the church. his wish was granted and word spread,â€™â€™ says fr dâ€™abreo. adds fr michael dâ€™souza, the parish priest, â€œthere are people who have come every sin-gle wednesday for years. i once asked a catholic gen-tleman who has been coming for 25 years what kept bringing him here. and he told me, â€˜i have never once fallen sick.â€™â€™ the church compound jostles with such storiesâ€” leaving little room for questioning and rationality. â€œmy mother was unable to have a baby,â€™â€™ says smita dongre, a domestic worker from santa cruz. â€œshe started a novena and i was born nine months later on christmas day. naturally i have vishwas.â€™â€™ adds mamta sheikh, a kurla housewife, â€œi first came to this church last february. our business was down, my husband wasnâ€™t getting a visa to the gulf, we were losing our house. we were planning to end it all by drinking poison.two months later, my husband got his visa, some cheques were cleared and every-thing changed.â€™â€™ as far as ms sheikh is concerned, the miracle con-tinues to unfold. â€œmy son sajid will be attending the evening service with his friendsâ€”one sikh, one hindu,â€™â€™ she says, pointing out that the novena brings disparate people together. â€œit makes us pray for each other, feel for each other, and reminds us that we all share the same fears and hopes. that is the most won-derful miracle of all.â€™â€™",0,0,0,0,0

ahmedabad: kutchis always feel they are distinct from gujaratis . their language is different and their culture is distinct from mainland gujarat. in fact, this is also the reason for a simmering demand for statehood in kutch which has never taken any serious shape. but if events unfolding over the last week have shown anything , kutchis are distinct from gujaratis even in their thinking. this vast district having the biggest percentage of muslim population (almost 35 per cent), has remained an island of peace in this ocean of violence that gujarat has turned into. the district has remained quit even as widespread violence broke out in neighbouring banaskantha, rajkot and surendranagar districts. was it the earthquake and the fact that many people are still piecing their lives together, or the traditional amity between the two communities, or the special efforts that the district police and administration made after last wednesday''s train massacre that were responsible for keeping the district''s peaceful record unblemished? perhaps , all three factors contributed to what has come out as a shining example of peaceful co-existence amidst grave provocation. and it is not that the district was entirely incident-free also. a mosque was damaged in nakatrana in a well-orchestrated move aimed at provocation. but following intervention by the police, the hindus of the locality have agreed to rebuild the place of worship and undo the damage. two persons were stabbed and injured in the same place and the police acted swiftly to arrest a local vhp activist, vasant patel. apart from that, there was an incident of arson in mandvi town which was quickly contained and prevented from spreading. says dr shyamsunder, a prominent physician who runs an ngo for the quake victims, ""by and large there is complete communal harmony in kutch compared to other places in gujarat, besides, having gone through the earthquake where hindus and muslims tried to help each other and are still in the process of rebuilding their lives, they certainly didn''t want to create a new problem for themselves"". the doctor says anjar town had witnessed a communal incident in 1970 and has been quiet ever since. officials however say the fact that kutchis are peaceful and secular, comparatively speaking, did help but special efforts were made as soon as news of the godhra incident trickled in. for example, official-level talks were held with the muslim leaders who were clearly upset with the attack on the train. the leaders were then encouraged to issue press statements expressing grief at the incident and announcing that they would voluntarily down their shutters the next day , not in support of the vhp sponsored bandh, but as a mark of solidarity to those who died in the tragegy. these statements were widely carried in the local newspapers. apart from this, the army was requested to move some of its forces inwards from the border on thursday during the bandh. as a result, 5 companies of the border wing of home guards and one company of border security force were stationed in and around bhuj. ""we had anticipated something would happen because the hindus were naturally very upset over godhra, but right from day one it was made clear that the security forces would brook no nonsense"", said superintendent of police vivek shrivastava. he said using his powers under the bombay police act, he had given police powers to the sarpanchs and the revenue officers to make arrests if there was any trouble. kutch collector harsh chibber said ""i have served in many districts of gujarat and i find that the harmony in the society is at a very different level in kutch than in other districts"". this, he said, was first in evidence during the earthquake when hindus helped the muslims and vice versa in all the localities with mixed population. ""maybe there are a lot of lessons to be learnt from kutch not only in how the human spirit can triumph over nature''s fury but how mutual respect and faith can be built between communities"", chibber said.",0,1,1,0,0

new delhi: participants at the two-day jal biradari sammelan felt that greater peopleâ€™s participation in water management would lead to equitable supply and reduced scarcity. the 750 people from 18 states are gathered in the capital to express their views on what the governmentâ€™s next water policy should be. the convention is organised under the aegis of tarun bharat sangh, an alwar-based ngo run by magsaysay-award winner rajendra singh, the times foundation and oxfam india trust. addressing the gathering, karnataka water resources minister h k patil said priority should be given to drought-prone areas. there was also a need to assess the availability of underground water in a region and if this was available, then no inter-basin transfer was required. highlighting the need for peopleâ€™s participation in water management, patil said that karnataka had spent rs 10,000 crore on irrigation to no avail. the solution lay in farmersâ€™ participation. hence, the state government had enacted laws to empower farmers with the right to manage and monitor water resources through cooperative societies. the governmentâ€™s role is thus limited to building projects like dams and canals â€” which would be later managed by the farmers themselves. nafisa barot from uthan, a gujarat-based ngo which has been working in the field of water conservation, told the times news network that since water security was the bottomline of economic viability, decentralised alternative means to conserve and harvest water were not only more cost effective and encouraged peopleâ€™s participation but also recharged and rejuvenated water resources instead of exhausting them. â€˜â€˜in urban areas, poor people are paying more for water because they do not have legal access while the rich get it at subsidised rates,â€™â€™ she said. measures like tax rebates would encourage these means which would in turn reduce the governmentâ€™s expenditure in supplying water, reduce scarcity and make rural and urban areas more self-reliant, she added.",0,0,0,0,0

571,328,"new delhi: after a day full of anxious moments with upset allies asking uncomfortable questions on the ayodhya issue, the vajpayee government managed to get a vote of confidence from the nda constituents. but missing at a crucial emergency nda meeting on wednesday evening were trinamul congress chief mamata banerjee and lok dal leader ajit singh. at the end of the 90-minute meeting, nda convenor and samata party leader george fernandes said the allies had unanimously decided to support the government''s decision to implement orders of the supreme court in respect to ayodhya and maintaining status quo in the acquired area. fernandes said the allies further expressed faith that the government would handle the situation in ayodhya as it ought to be. significantly absent were mamata banerjee and ajit singh, both of whom had earlier in the day met the prime minister to object to the way attorney general soli sorabjee had put before the supreme court that a symbolic puja could be permitted on the undisputed land. while the nda explained mamata''s staying away from the meeting as inability to contact her, the trinamul chief herself told times news network in the evening that the prime minister had called an nda meeting at 6 pm at his 7 race course road residence. clearly distraught, mamata said: ""we have conveyed to the prime minister our extreme disapproval of what happened in the supreme court."" she, however, said the situation in the country was too tense to contemplate withdrawal of support to the vajpayee government at the moment. ""let us first tackle march 15. we cannot take a decision all of a sudden."" nda allies would meet among themselves on the issue, she said. the allies are to meet early on thursday morning. the government, put in the dock early in the day by the opposition parties, stressed that it had nothing to do with sorabjee''s opinion expressed before the court. the attorney general himself clarified that he had given a legal interpretation of the 1994 judgment of the apex court before the judges, who had sought his opinion. the government, he maintained, had no role to play. but an angry opposition stalled proceedings in both houses of parliament demanding a statement from the prime minister and accusing him of doublespeak on the ayodhya issue. even the allies were moved to huddle into confabulations, including a telephone conversation with tdp chief chandrababu naidu in hyderabad, before six parties met the prime minister to convey their dissatisfaction. naidu, thanks to his clout within the nda and the opposition, is widely seen as someone who can decide the future of the nda government. apart from mamata and ajit singh, tdp leader yerran naidu, lok janshakti leader ram vilas paswan, and leaders of the dmk and the jd(u) were also present. emerging from the meeting, a senior leader said: ""this is highly objectionable. we are not satisfied with the government''s explanation that the attorney general was merely interpreting the 1994 judgment."" upset that they had not been consulted on so key a matter, the leader said: ""even if the government explanation is accurate, public perception is important too, so this should not have been done."" devendra prasad yadav of the jd(u) even suggested that sorabjee be removed. an irked mamata remarked: ""this is not a bjp government it is an nda government."" however, the bjp has come out strongly in favour of sorabjee. bjp spokesperson v k malhotra said: ""we endorse what the ag has said to the court. the bjp supports sorabjee''s assertion that the puja should be held under strict conditions."" malhotra also tried to disassociate the government from sorabjee''s statement. ""whatever the ag has said was not part of a written submission or an affidavit filed by the government. what sorabjee has said may not necessarily be the government''s view,"" said malhotra. the opposition, expectedly, is doing its best to stoke the fire. veteran cpm leader somnath chatterjee said, ""the secular allies have to decide now whether the country''s future is in safe hands"". later in the evening, the congress working committee passed a resolution condemning the government''s change of stand after having maintained in parliament and through the president''s address in the beginning of the session that it favoured status quo in ayodhya. the party has indicated that it will take on vajpayee in parliament on the issue. related storiesÂ govt clamps down on vhp activistsÂ temporary jails to keep ram bhaktsÂ vhp finds a loophole, says will still have pujaÂ nda allies back centre''s standÂ govt will obey sc order, says pmÂ govt was not keen on puja: sorabjeeÂ sc rules out symbolic puja in ayodhyaÂ nyas to go ahead with shila donationÂ chronology of eventsÂ full coverageÂ Â Â voice your opinionÂ text of supreme court ruling

573,337,"ayodhya: the continuing administrative squeeze around ayodhya and faizabad got tighter on saturday, with the cancellation or diversion of all trains reaching the twin towns till further notice. the last of the trains, carrying some 2,000 karsevaks from ayodhya, left town on friday evening. ironically enough, it was the sabarmati express, bound for ahmedabad in gujarat, the same ill-fated train which was attacked in godhra last wednesday. the lack of easy transportation to and from ayodhya has already begun to reflect in the numbers at karsevakpuram, the vhp headquarters in ayodhya. just before noon, the site of the purna ahuti yagna conducted every morning since february 24 looks deserted but for a dozen or so karsevaks. ''we have strict instructions not to let the media in,'' says the young volunteer in-charge of regulating the negligible human traffic to the holy fire. asked to explain the dwindling human mass, the local media in-charge of the vhp, sharad sharma, starts with a sullen denial. since the trains were stopped on friday, some 2,000 karsevaks arrived on saturday by other means. the local bjp leaders, re-elected mla lallu singh and the faizabad district party president mahant manmohan das, are more forthright. because of the administration's dictatorial ban on rail and road travel, religious-minded karsevaks are being prevented from reaching ayodhya, they complain. there are no exact estimates of how many karsevaks are still left behind in ayodhya. the figure varies from an optimistic 4,000 to an improbable 10,000. requests to visit ramsevakpuram — the semi-permanent township which houses the vhp volunteers — for an independent assessment, are firmly turned down. ''the karsevaks have told us not to send anyone from the media there... because the media can some times be too aggressive with its questioning,'' says sharma. that might be so, but he clearly has other things on his mind. on friday evening, a wire service photographer was manhandled inside ramsevakpuram and his chain snatched. just a stone's throw away from karsevakpuram, the administration has, in the past 24 hours, part-sealed the workshop where stone pillars for the proposed temple are being chiseled and carved. the gate used for bulk transportation has been locked up, with a single-file side entrance allowed for individual access. the men in uniform posted outside have orders not to let anyone unlock the main gate. but none of this is having a reassuring impact in the muslim areas of the temple town. from kutia to panjitola, kajiara to begumpura, the mood among the minorities remains grimly nervous. many families have moved their women and young ones to safer areas. but it is impossible to ascertain how many. mohammed salim, nephew of hashim ansari, the man who filed the original court petition against the installation of ram idols in 1949, claims that nearly every muslim family in panjitola located within shouting distance of the barbed-wire fencing that marks off the acquired land around the disputed masjid has seen some safety-driven migration. but in faizabad, khalil ahmed khan, of the faizabad helal committee, has compiled a list complete as of friday of those muslim families who have left ayodhya for safer destinations. while khan feels that the administration has clearer directions today than in december 1992 - both from the court and the central government to maintain the peace and status quo, there is ample room for concern.

ahmedabad: february 22, 7.50 pm: the ahmedabad railway station in kalupur area resounded with chants of ''har har mahadev'' playing on a loudspeaker. kar sevaks of all ages crowded around the sabarmati express ready for departure with very little baggage. some of them were chanting ''jai shri ram'' accompanied by cymbals. the train was flagged off amid a surge of saffron. february 27: the train we had nearly seen off, carrying old women and ram sevaks, enroute jaipur, was singed and spoke of bloodshed at godhra. by saturday, a deathly calm followed... the return from jaipur was quite an irony. the usually crowded railway station was bare with a couple of residents awaiting relatives and moving about like zombies. travelling by the ahmedabad-bound ashram express from delhi was never so difficult - this time the problem was not a crowded train, but vacant coaches and easily available reservations. when the train chugged out of jaipur station, the lone coolie on this platform cautioned: ""aap jaa to rahe ho ... hame bolna nahi chahiye per jaana thik nahi hai (you are going so i should not speak like this, but its not safe to go there now)"". pointing at the empty platform number 1, he said, ""you would not find an inch of space to put your feet."" ironically, there were hardly any people to board one of the most crowded train on saturday night. once inside the coach, the ticket examiner seemed quite hassled. he answered an anxious passenger, who wanted to know whether there were more passengers or not. he showed a blank passenger list, with a few names dotting the page. ""no one travels at such a time ... not to a place like ahmedabad at least,"" replied an amdavadi who had boarded the train. soon a conversation breaks among the passengers and everyone asks each other the purpose of travelling. ""why are you going to ahmedabad? people go away from gujarat,"" remarked a fellow passenger to another who was asking for directions to reach a friend''s place in the burning city. the train stops a little outside jaipur. ""yaar rajasthan hai tab tak thik hai, gujarat me mat khadi karna warna kriya karam bhi vahin ho jayega...,"" quips another amid nervous laughter. some decided to call it a day and steal a few snores till the rajasthan border ended. but not for long. a couple of hours later the train arrives at ajmer and tension is writ large on everyone''s face. the station was clogged with frenzied families from the minority community that had left ahmedabad to save themselves from mob frenzy, perhaps seeking shelter at the khwaja moinuddin chisti''s dargah. ""hundreds of them have come here in last three days,"" a constable standing guard at the coach shows the platforms of ajmer station with barely any space to crouch. some of the passengers run to board the train and the doors are instantly slammed. portals open reluctantly only after tickets are shown. the other coaches are urgently sealed as railway cops patrol the coaches and count and re-count the number of passengers. presence of members of another community with women and children, turns everyone quiet and uneasy. a sigh of relief is heaved soon as they board a nearby coach. the famous ajmeri ''rabdi'' is forgotten and there are no vendors either. all that resounds in this station are cacophonic announcements about this train bound for ahmedabad. the arrival at ahmedabad was a chilly reminder of the reality. burnt buildings, suspicious people on sides of the rail tracks and more coolies than passengers. a city gone unrecognisable in one week.

ayodhya: unfazed by the supreme court verdict, the vishwa hindu parishad (vhp) working president ashok singhal has said that they would go ahead with their â€˜shila daanâ€™ and also â€˜pujanâ€™ programme on march 15 at the site â€˜withinâ€™ ram janambhoomi complex. holding a joint press conference, the vhp working president and ram janmabhoomi nyas chairman ramchandra paramhans das said that the supreme court order prohibits any â€˜pujaâ€™ or activity at the plot nos. 159 and 160 in 67 acres of land and they are now free to hold any programme on remaining land within the ram janmabhoomi complex where the apex court order is not applicable. interpreting the court verdict to suit their purposes, both the leaders claimed that the apex court order was not against their march 15 programme as the vhp never planned to hold any programme on plot nos. 159 and 160. â€œwe had announced to hold our programme only on the undisputed land.â€� even though they showed the map of the rjb complex, yet they did not clarify which land they would hold their programme. â€œthe place would be close to the site where artefacts and other articles are lying within the rjb complex,â€� said singhal. itâ€™s like coming back to square one. after changing their stand every day, the vhp on wednesday returned to its original plan saying that there is no difference between â€˜shila daanâ€™ and â€˜shila-pujanâ€™ and they would now hold both these programmes as scheduled earlier. â€œwe respect the court verdict and would not hold any programme on plot nos. 159 and 160. about 2,000 ramsevaks, including 500 local seers, saints and â€˜sadhusâ€™ would participate in the three-hour-long programme. about 50 vedic scholars from varanasi and ayodhya would conduct the â€˜pujaâ€™ ceremony as per vedic rituals,â€� disclosed singhal. welcoming the apex court judgment, the vhp has, however, put the ball in the vajpayee governmentâ€™s court saying that it was up to the central government now to allow our programme or arrest us. â€œwe are contacting the government of india to grant us permission for holding the programme. the decision is to be taken by them now. if disallowed, we would court arrest.â€� the vhp also appreciated the vajpayee governmentâ€™s last-ditch attempt to seek some relief from the apex court on their march 15 programme. the vhp working president said that the 51-member mandir nirman samiti which is scheduled to hold a meeting on thursday in ayodhya would review the supreme court verdict and take a decision on march 15 as well as temple construction plan. he, however, said that place and time of the meeting was yet to be decided. the vhp also announced that a â€˜ram naam japâ€™ would be organised all over the country on march 15 at 2.15 pm. earlier, the rjn chairman mahant ramchandra paramhans das said he would go ahead with his programme to donate a carved pillar to the receiver at the makeshift temple after performing â€˜pujaâ€™.â€� with vhp announcing to go ahead with their plan and the government under pressure from opposition and allies to disallow their programme, a confrontation seems inevitable on march 15.",0,0,0,0,0

""there is no legal hurdle. the government can give permission for anything"", he said. eight of the 10 sants who had met vajpayee after the chetawani yatra in january were present at monday''s meeting. the members of the trust are scheduled to meet again on tuesday. related storiesÂ vhp, rss leaders hold talksÂ number of kar sevaks dwindle in ayodhya Â vhp, bjp workers named in fir on riotsÂ authorities lock vhp''s workshop in ayodhya

ahmedabad: gujarat returned to a relative calm on wednesday, a full week after the godhra train massacre, even as simmering tensions led to stray incidents in some parts of the state. in pahad village of mehmdabad, one person, who was working as a cook, was stabbed to death. four stab injury victims were admitted to municipal hospitals in ahmedabad - one each from rakhial, naranpura and gheekantha, and one from khedbrahma in sabarkantha district. the overall toll of gujarat touched the 544-mark by wednesday afternoon, excluding the 58 persons killed in the godhra incident last wednesday. out of this, 97 died in police firing, while the remaining were killed during other incidents of mob violence, according to the police control room, which also stated that the toll is going up because of the recovery of bodies in villages and not due to fresh killings. while the control room in ahmedabad claimed there was complete calm in the city overnight, stray incidents of violence were reported from other parts of the state. police said so far 3,976 persons have been arrested all over the state. in ahmedabad, shops, which opened in the walled city areas in the morning, downed their shutters following reports about fresh stabbing incidents which were denied by police. schools and other educational institutions also opened on wednesday after a week''s break and the city bus service also resumed. in surat, police said that two clashing groups resorted to severe stone pelting in the sensitive limbayat area on tuesday night around 10 pm. police intercepted and had to fire 8 rounds. police commissioner v k gupta said 10 persons sustained injuries in the firing. in combing operations carried out in surat on tuesday evening, 50 persons were held and a large quantity of weapons, including swords, knives, pipes and axes were seized. also, acid bulbs and crude petroleum bombs were seized during these operations. so far more than 432 arrests have been made in the city in connection with 80 cases of substantive offence of rioting, arson and murder since february 28. while control rooms in various cities claim of peace prevailing in the state, rumours of fresh violence in jhalod taluka of dahod district ran high. senior officials of vadodara range, however, denied of any such report. in bharuch, senior officials of the police department along with prominent citizens and district collector anju sharma led a peace march.

mumbai: while the country watched with horror as godhra burned, old-timers recalled that this town in gujarat is no stranger to communal riots. in fact, a carnage which erupted in godhra more than 70 years ago had a profound impact on the life of former prime minister morarji desai.in 1928, desai was the deputy collector of godhra, a post from which he resigned after the riots. a biography of the late pm, written by veteran journalist d.f. karaka, reveals that the british administration wanted desai to lay the blame for the disturbances at the door of the majority community. unwilling to comply, desai quit the service and joined the freedom struggle.morarji, which was published by the times of india press in 1965, carries a detailed account of the godhra incident. desai told his biographer that the district collector, one mr hartshone, was evidently partial and unfairly wanted to blame the hindus for the riot. interestingly, the assistant collector h.v.r. iengar, who later became governor of the reserve bank of india, stood by desai in the subsequent court hearing.the trial court judge millard, who was deputed as special magistrate for this case, apparently observed that desai was siding with the hindus. in the course of the trial, desai was cross-examined for an entire day by defence counsel i.i. chundrigar, who later became pakistan''s prime minister. ``but he could not find a flaw in my evidence,'''' desai has been quoted as saying.desai also criticised the district superintendent of police, a mr ziauddin, for his role in the affair.when the case went to the sessions court in appeal, the sessions judge exonerated desai of all the strictures that millard had passed against him. desai''s name was thus cleared of the allegation that he was anti-muslim. but enraged by the events, desai demanded a transfer.when this request was denied, he went on leave for four months until he was posted as personal assistant to the collector of ahmedabad. hartshone then brought pressure on the bureaucracy to institute a departmental inquiry against desai. this was completed in april 1930, and resulted in a sharp demotion. this proved the last straw, and desai resigned.the rest, of course, is history. desai plunged into the freedom struggle, met mahatma gandhi and returned to the government in 1937--this time as a minister. but he always maintained that godhra had proved to be a turning point in his life.

rajkot: it would seem that the state police has failed to learn from past mistakes, with the result that the state keeps witnessing communal killings at regular intervals. a senior police officer here maintained that the incident at godhra was one such clear cut case mistake where the police failed to move in a timely manner and avert not only the incident at godhra but also the resultant flare up. or was it also a case of intelligence failure on part of the police force? the officer, wishing anonymity, maintained that during the 1992 babri masjid demolition and the period before that, riots had broken out at palej railway station near vadodara when the ram sevaks had provoked the local population. similar incidents were also reported from dahod soon after the babri masjid demolition. this time also, when the state police knew that there was large scale movement of ram sevaks to ayodhya, the state police could have acted fast and asked the dsps in all the areas, through which the ram sevaks would be travelling, to be on high alert. mostly, majority of the ram sevaks move from gujarat and maharashtra to ayodhya, whenever such a call is given by the vhp or the bajrang dal. the local dsps could have been asked to be more alert to any such untoward movement or unusual gathering of mobs . this is a usually well followed guideline in the police force, as gujarat is a communally sensitive spot and even a spark could turn into an inferno. according to the police officer, things had started hotting up as early as january, when the ram sevaks had started moving to ayodhya and their movement was much publicised. this should have sent alarm bells ringing in the ears of senior police officers and the director general of police. the officer also maintained that if the state intelligence bureau could keep the chief minister''s office informed of his political future in rajkot-2, they could have also done so with regards to such mass movement of ram sevaks and the possible fallout of such movement. even if one presumes that the intelligence bureau did warn the state government, it failed to pass on the message to the ranks below and it certainly did not reach the panchmahal dsp raju bhargav and if it did, then he was lax on acting on the alert or was he thought that things would pass off peacefully. well, whatever is the truth, a judicial probe in to the matter would possibly bring out the truth!",0,0,1,1,0

hyderabad: the all india babri masjid action committee (aimac) has accused the bjp of masterminding the ongoing communal riots in various parts of the country to pave the way for the transfer of disputed land in ayodhya to the vishwa hindu parishad (vhp). aimac convener zafaryab jeelani told reporters on saturday that the riots were planned about two months ago by the bjp-led central government. â€œat the end of the vhpâ€™s chetavni yatra from ayodhya to delhi on jan. 27, prime minister atal behari vajpayee had announced that the vhpâ€™s demand of transferring the disputed land has been referred to law minister arun jaitley. subsequently, the vhp leaders announced that they would start construction of a ram temple from march 15,â€� he said. jeelani said all those statements were made by the bjp and vhp leaders to polarise the voters during the assembly elections in uttar pradesh and other states. having lost the elections in all four states, the bjp then decided to transfer the disputed land by â€œpressuring itselfâ€™â€™ through the communal violence unleashed by the vhp. â€œvajpayee may now enter into a secret deal with the vhp for transferring the disputed land to buy peace in the country,â€� jeelani said, adding that such a deal would be a blatant violation of the supreme court orders. he requested that everybody should respect the courtâ€™s verdict he said the muslims and the secular forces in the country would never accept any such plan and they would resist all such moves. the shahi imam of the jama masjid of bihar, quari aqlaqi quasmi, was also present on the occasion.",0,0,0,0,0

lucknow: vishwa hindu parishad working president ashok singhal described prime minister atal bihari vajpayee''s statement that the government would abide by the supreme courtâ€™s verdict as a breach of agreement reached on shankaracharya jayendra saraswatiâ€™s proposals on the march 15 â€˜shila pujanâ€™ programme in ayodhya. talking to presspersons at the amausi airport here on monday, the vhp working president was allowed to leave for ayodhya after he had an unscheduled meeting with governor vishnu kant shastri for over an hour-and-a-half at the raj bhawan. singhal pointed out that supreme court was nowhere in the picture when the kanchi seer was mediating on the ayodhya impasse. â€œby going to the supreme court, the prime minister has discredited the jayendra sarswati proposals.â€� â€œi am suprised at the prime ministerâ€™s decision as at no point of time during the negotiations there was any mention of the apex court,â€� he said angrily. unfazed by the change in prime ministerâ€™s stand and the possible outcome of the supreme court verdict on march 13, the vhp working president declared that there was no change in vhpâ€™s march 15 programme. â€œwe would perform a symbolic â€˜shila pujanâ€™ peacefully at the acquired land on march 15 as planned. a large number of ramsevaks are expected to participate in the programme,â€� said a defiant singhal.he also showed annoyance over massive security arrangements in the temple town. â€œduring talks the prime minister had assured to lift security restrictions but nothing had been done so far.â€� the vhp working president, who went to ayodhya to oversee preparations for the march 15 programme, demanded immediate lifting of curbs on movement in the temple town. the uttar pradesh government was apparently in two minds on whether or not to arrest singhal. his arrest warrant was understood to have been signed at 12.30 pm. the district magistarte jeevesh nandan and ssp bb bakshi suddenly surfaced at the aiport with force, 15 minutes before singhalâ€™s flight landed. but for some reasons the government allowed him to leave for ayodhya. â€œkya desh ki fiza kharab karni hai (do they want to vitiate the countryâ€™s atmosphere),â€� countered singhal when asked on the possibility of his arrest. the arrest warrant was subsequently withdrawn at 1.45 pm and the district officials took singhalâ€™s convoy to the raj bhawan. governor vishnu kant shastri held one-to-one talk with singhal and is learnt to have persuaded him to shelve his ayodhya programme.",0,0,1,1,0

the gujarat government has banned ptv in the state. the ban is of a price with the overall current inclination in this country to look for the hand across the border whenever things go wrong on native soil. but while people in ahmedabad, vadodara and elsewhere may not have access to reactions to the riots in islamabad or karachi, what about the pictures of happenings in their cities being beamed across the entire world? bbc world for instance went to town with visuals of armed goons roaming the streets and the commentary that hindus were attacking muslims. the power of the electronic media once more became evident as riots broke out. those in authority both in delhi and ahmedabad could only hem and haw at the clear evidence of police inaction during the initial stages of the riots and even later in the countryside where the cops admitted that they were not being able to do anything to control the situation. the print media are obviously handicapped in this regard and its accusations can always, be and is, denied. but with the electronic media, it is here and now, those against whom the finger is pointed are themselves telling the story through their inaction, unaware perhaps that everything is being filmed. aware of what was being seen by millions and their reaction, union minister arun jaitley almost told the media, while appearing on star news, to exercise restraint in the national interest. how often have we heard that plea? where was the concern for national interest when gujarat was allowed to burn and the government came out with the flimsy excuse that the army could not be deployed earlier as it took time to arrange for area maps. though narendra modi is new to the job, even he should have known that such maps are always there with the police and only have to be asked for. having said this, however, one does feel that the electronic media should also think twice about treating a communal holocaust as yet another story which needs to be explored thoroughly. for instance, the big fight programme on star, featuring narendra mohan, a bjp member of the rajya sabha. why he is being singled out for mention is the way he almost violently defended the â€œhinduâ€� cause. such reactions can only steel the determination throughout the country to go in for further mayhem. such programmes certainly do not serve any purpose as in any case the nation knows what mohan, his party and the sangh parivar stand for. generally speaking, however, things could not have been kept under wraps as jaitley would have liked. and why did pramod mahajan get so excited on sahara channel when s. nihal singh politely inquired as to whether the prime minister did not give the impression of an aged man no longer sure of himself. seeing atal behari vajpayee these days thatâ€™s exactly the impression viewers get. karangapara village in west bengalâ€™s durgapur is not only far away from gujarat, but it seems to live in a world of its own judging from an etv bangla programme. the village has never seen any political activity, no wall writing, no disputes leave alone killings. not that it is located in the back of beyond, it is fairly prosperous, judging from the visuals and its residents as alert as anybody else. but, as a political activist sought to explain, â€œwe do our political work outside the village and do not allow our own atmosphere to be polluted.â€� selfish, would you say? and if politics is polluting why go for it, even outside the village?",0,0,0,1,0

""it has to be able to take decisions on its own,"" he said. the cpi(m), in a separate statement, has also demanded that the state be declared a disturbed area. the delegation, also comprising film stars and mps raj babbar and shabana azmi, alleged that the uncooperative state government refused to provide security and prevented them from visiting riot-hit areas. the entire night was spent waiting at the police commissionerâ€™s office for a permit. ""not even a peon met us there"", said amar singh. the four leaders, however, did visit a hospital where victims of the sabarmati express incident and the subsequent riots were being treated and heard tales of ""inhuman horror."" at pains to condemn the ghodra incident, singh said that in no way justified what the minority community had been subjected to after that. ""some mischievous elements"" had tried to communalise the incident, he said, and blamed a state government-police nexus for fanning the fire. the team said the death toll in the riots was much more than what the government was admitting, though it was difficult to assess how much. babbar accused the vishwa hindu parishad of ""giving birth to terrorism"" and demanded that the outfit, along with the bajrang dal, be banned immediately. asked about why the opposition had been tardy in its condemnation of the ghodra incident, an angry yechuri said: we donâ€™t need a certificate from the bjp that we are patriots. mahatma gandhiâ€™s murderers cannot teach us to be patriotic."" he described the situation in gujarat as state-sponsored terrorism.

chandigarh: bjp''s central leadership has advised a ''wait and watch'' policy to its haryana unit over the latter''s demand to sever its alliance with the ruling indian national lok dal (inld) led by chief minister om prakash chautala. the election committee of the party, which met in delhi on march 9 to review the party''s performance in the recent assembly elections, took up the haryana unit''s demand casually, advising it to show restraint as the senior leadership of the party is at present busy with developments in uttar pradesh and gujarat. the haryana unit of the bjp has been clamouring for quite a while to snap its ties with the inld on the plea that it is losing its foothold as well as its identity in the state as it is never taken into confidence by inld while taking important policy decisions. this battle of nerves between the two parties reached a flash point on the eve of the recent yamunanagar assembly bye-election for which the inld also decided to field its candidate despite the fact that the bjp had already declared its candidate. in the last assembly elections, which the two had fought jointly, this seat had fallen in bjp''s kitty. defending his party''s decision to field its candidate for the bye-election, inld supremo chautala is on record having stated that the bjp''s state unit had violated the very norms of alliance as it did not show the courtesy of taking his party into confidence while deciding about its candidate.so disturbed was the state leadership of the bjp at that time over chautala''s allegation that it sought its central leadership''s permission to part ways with the inld. political observers feel that the irony is that while the state unit has its own political compulsions, its leadership in delhi cannot afford to annoy the inld which is supporting the vajpayee government as an important constituent of the ruling national democratic alliance( inld).the inld has five members in the lok sabha. in fact, it is widely felt in the political circles here that what has added to the worries of the state unit of bjp is its dismal performance against an impressive victory of the inld in the yamunanagar bye-election. even more disturbing for its leadership is that the party suffered defeat despite the fact that yamunanagar constituency is considered to be its stronghold. such was the defeat that the party candidate even lost his security in the bye-election. whether or not the bjp supports the inld in the coming rajya sabha elections is a moot point.the latter will, however, require its support to win both the seats in the elections, which are due to be held on march 27. but doubts still persist about the longevity of the alliance.talking to media persons recently in the press lobby of the assembly, leader of the bjp legislature party krishan pal gujjar expressed confidence that the days of his party''s alliance with the inld were numbered.",0,0,0,0,0

lucknow: infuriated over the vishwa hindu parishadâ€™s climbdown, ram janmabhoomi nyas (rjn) chairman mahant ramchandra paramhans das has threatened to boycott the vhp-sponsored programme of symbolic puja in ayodhya on march 15. in a telephonic interview with the times news network from ayodhya, mahant das said that â€œhe may not participate in the proposed â€˜symbolic shila pujanâ€™. â€œmain wahan jaaun ya na jaaun yeh meri marzi hai. waise ab meri ichchha nahi hai wahan jaane ki (its my decision to go there or not but i donâ€™t feel like going there now),â€� said the paramhans, who is also the chairman of mandir nirman samiti, which has been entrusted with the task of beginning the construction of ram temple by the dharam sansad. the paramhans had earlier boycotted the â€˜sant chetawani yatra, which began from ayodhya on january 20. it was only after much persuasion from senior vhp leaders and prominent seers, that he had agreed to join it at a later stage. there are reasons for him to be annoyed with the vhp leadership. firstly, he was not taken into confidence when the vhp gave an undertaking that it would abide by the court verdict. a vhp leader said that when the paramhans came to know about the undertaking he threatened to withdraw from the negotiating team. it was only after vhp general secretary acharya giriraj kishore held a press conference the next day and issued a contradiction that he relented. secondly, he was infuriated over the vhp and the government involving the all-india muslim personal board in the talks and allowing kanchi seer jayendra saraswati to force them to accept the compromise formula without the centre giving them any assurance on transferring the acquired land to rjn by june 2. ashok singhalâ€™s announcement the very next day that the vhp has actually given an undertaking to accept the court verdict saw the paramhans pack his bags. he not only withdrew from the talks but also refused to sign the agreement on the compromise formula prepared by jayendra saraswati. â€œask singhalji about the agreement. i did not put my signature. i came back the from the delhi same night,â€� was his answer when asked about the much talked about delhi agreement. does he agree to the â€˜symbolicâ€™ shila pujan with one carved stone as suggested by saraswati formula? the paramhans retorted: â€œsinghalji se puchhiye, unhe sab pata hai...ab wahi sub kuchch jaanein (ask singhalji, he should know everything). he said that he would now keep mum on all issues relating to march 15 programme. even though the union minister of state for home id swami called on the agitated paramhans to pacify him, he seems to be in no mood to relent. with one of the main architects of rjb movement threatening to pull out at this crucial stage, a lot of fireworks are expected during the crucial meeting of mandir nirman samiti to be held in ayodhya on march 14. senior vhp leaders are rushing back to ayodhya to pacify the paramhans, who is the mahant of the digambar akhara.",0,0,0,0,0

ahmedabad: oranges, sugar candy and blessings came the riot victims'' way as the shankaracharya of kanchipuram, jayendra saraswati, came calling on the godhra carnage victims'' families and riot victims of the city on thursday. from juntanagar in ramol to chaurasia ni chali along geeta mandir road to the civil hospital, the seer met victims'' kins and reassured them and prayed for peace. it all started at the sardar vallabhbhai patel international airport premises where a motley crowd waited for shankaracharya''s arrival. the state treasurer of the bjp, surendra patel, and leader of the opposition at ahmedabad municipal corporation, dharmendra shah, stood for the saffron brigade, while vhp was represented by state general secretary jaydeep patel and senior worker devjibhai rawat. soon the saffron-clad seer from kanchi flew into the airport aboard a private aircraft. another brief spell of wait followed and finally the shankaracharya was ready. a motorcade of no less than 20 vehicles zoomed out of the airport premises and headed for the first destination - juntanagar in ramol area. ten ram sevaks from juntanagar itself had been burnt alive on board the sabarmati express at godhra. the seer in his purple-hued land cruiser zipped into juntanagar where localites and victims'' family members chanted: ""shri ram, jai ram..."" under a small shamiana set up near girishbhai panchal''s residence. panchal had lost four members of his family in the godhra carnage. right arm raised, showering blessings and his face lit up in a benevolent smile, the shankaracharya stayed at the site for no more than five minutes and scarcely spoke a word. young mayur chaundagarh tried hard, in vain, to pass a photo of his aunt amiben (31) - one of the 58 godhra victims - for shankaracharya''s blessings. it was time to leave and the motorcade zoomed along the narol-naroda highway, slowing down occasionally to look at soot-covered and burnt buildings lining the road. minutes later the seer was once again surrounded by eager devotees and godhra victims'' family members at chaurasia ni chali along geeta mandir road. this locality had lost two members - jiniben dabi and premben dabi to the godhra massacre. a narrow lane that led to the victims'' houses was packed to capacity with localities wishing to catch a glimpse of the godman. a brief stop outside a victim''s house and it was time to move on again. the next halt was at geeta mandir in khagrapith area. media persons were treated to some excerpts from ''ramayan'' and advised to refrain from ""unnecessarily playing up sporadic incidents of violence"" and asked to ""aid in restoring peace in gujarat"". ""i am pained by the bloodshed in gujarat and my visit is aimed at blessing the victims and pray for the return of peace in gujarat. god is one and so is our mother - bharat mata. members of both communities should live like brothers and not get swayed by emotional outbursts. we should live in peace like ram and laxman, not like bali and sugreev,"" he said. ""after the earthquake i had visited kutch and bhuj and had stayed here for a week. i have once again come to help calamity-struck people of gujarat. the state government should hasten its relief and rehabilitation measures and should remain secular in its outlook at all costs,"" he said. ""i have also spoken to the union minister for home on relief activities in gujarat,"" he added. the godman also pledged to help reinstate peace in the state and aid the localities in restarting economic and academic activities. amidst chants of ''jai shree ram'' the holyman left geeta mandir for the civil hospital. a huge crowd of inquisitive onlookers and devotees eager to touch shankaracharya''s feet waited there as the visitors entered g1 block (burns and plastic surgery ward) of civil hospital. this was the longest stop made by the godman. the hospital tour commenced with the godhra victims, who were the first to be blessed with oranges and clothes by the godman. shankaracharya then called on other riot victims of the city.

lucknow: as the ayodhya crisis deepens, the repercussion is beginning to affect the state administration, particularly the police. the fear of being dragged into unavoidable controversies is making the officers chicken out. no one is keen to touch ayodhya with a bargepole, it seems. the temple town right now is a simmering cauldron. the inspector-general of police lucknow zone (which covers faizabad) has proceeded on long leave. the ig was insisting that he be relieved. but his bosses have been trying to pursuade him to resume duty. after a stalemate, the ig finally proceeded on a long medical leave recently, it is understood. what has compounded the crisis is the administrationâ€™s inability to find a suitable replacement as no officer is ready to assume igâ€™s charge even on temporary basis. and if sources are to be believed, possibility of more senior officials â€œfalling sickâ€� before march 15 cannot be ruled out. sources said that the state authorities did make efforts to fill up the vacant post but no officer was willing to stick his neck on the chopping block. director-general of police rk pandit, while talking to times news network on monday, confirmed that the ig was on long leave and that no replacement had been found yet despite the ongoing developments in ayodhya. the dgp , however, refused to comment on the reasons behind departmentâ€™s inability to find a replacement. â€œwe are in total control of the situation and top ranking officials are camping in ayodhya . there seems to be no crisis at all,â€� he said. though officially the leave was taken on medical grounds following doctorsâ€™ advice to stay away from exertion and stress, sources said that ig rk bhatia, like a chunk of other senior ips officers in the state, had expressed reservations over the manner in which the ayodhya situation was being handled. â€œthe political situation is fluid and one never knows what could happen in ayodhya with all the chaos and confusion in the corridors of power,â€� said a senior ips officer, hinting at the absence of a popular government in the state. â€œthe recent controversy about armyâ€™s deployment in ayodhya is a glaring example of the lack of coordination between different centres of power within the state administration,â€� the officer said. seeking of army help for ayodhya stirred a hornetâ€™s nest when the defence minister on saturday said that the up administration had sought army deployment while governor vishnukant shastri insisted that the army was only asked to stay on alert. â€œwith such a confusion, no sincere officer would like to stay back to bear the brunt when support from top brass is also doubtful. in case of any mishandling of the situation, senior officers may face the music,â€� opined another senior police officer.",0,0,1,1,0

663,535,"the bjp's debacle in up and uttaranchal has proved once again that the loyalty of its voters cannot be taken for granted. if the seats of the two assemblies and the party positions in them are combined, the bsp and the congress, followed by the sp, emerge as the real gainers. in terms of percentage representation in the assemblies, the bsp raised it from 15 per cent to 22, while the congress from 8 per cent to 13. the corresponding figures for sp are 25 and 30. thus, while all three gained, the bjp lost sizably. from about 41 per cent in undivided up, it barely managed about 27 per cent, that too after adding its allies. how does one explain the rout of this 'party with a difference'? the caste arithmetic theory provides only a partial answer, if any. the real causes are, one, that the bjp could not appreciate the impact of modernity, which was making people impatient for palpable results, and two, it continued to believe that for indians, caste and religious considerations received precedence over their developmental needs. consequently, it could neither read the real meaning of the creation of three new states — although it supported their creation — nor throw off the hindutva baggage, which it knew had become a liability. behind the creation of uttaranchal, jharkhand and chhattisgarh, there was an acute sense of relative deprivation, not ethnicity. similarly, no hindu required vhp's homily to be proud of his faith. for most of them, a ram temple at ayodhya was okay, not something they could not live without — particularly if it consumed so much of the states' energy, which could have otherwise been productively used. it is a pity that the bjp top brass understood it but could not rise to the occasion. following the godhra incident, home minister l k advani now talks of leashing the vhp, but it may be too late. post 9/11 the world has changed which means a no-nonsense approach to religious extremism. the bjp's turning a blind eye to the hindutva brigades' christian bashing or its rowdy acts against valentine day enthusiasts have evidently not enthused voters. making a bonfire of valentine cards may make a front-page story in a newspaper but cannot gloss the fact that the same newspaper carries four pages of classified valentine messages. the party has lost touch with the reality of our youths. when conventional courses like history, sociology and political science are going abegging in universities for enrolment as most students are opting for management and technical courses, the party is wasting time rewriting indian history and introducing astrology courses. it is anachronism par excellence. if the bjp wants to regain its initiative it would have to change its rhetoric first. but the problem is that when a leopard changes its stripes, it does not remain a leopard. and that is the bjp's predicament.

oh god, give us strong enough words to condemn the carnage of godhra, the rest of gujarat and some other parts of the country. the present ones have become obsolete. or, if the senseless killings that have taken place during the past 55 years, first in united and then in partitioned india, are the logical corollary of adherence to religion, the humanity would rather do well without it. the clean chit that home minister advani and other bjp leaders have given to gujarat chief minister modi is understandable, but what defies intelligence is the distinction made between the victims of godhra and other parts of the state. no amount of money can fill the void the dependents of those killed or burnt alive will have to face. but to discriminate in â€œcompensatingâ€� the deaths is beyond all comprehension. the ayodhya mess seems to be inching towards some sort of adjustment. but there are still many pitfalls: some of which are, (1) what credence can be given to the vhp which has a record of flouting the earlier ones, (2) is the â€œundisputedâ€� land really undisputed as it includes a large graveyard of the muslims and by handing over the land the area where the masjid stood will become inaccessible, and (3) what will be the stand of the nda constituents. however, the kanchi shankaracharya deserves all praise for introducing an element of sanity. the murder of a samajwadi party mla at the main gate of raj bhawan has overshadowed the governorâ€™s advocacy of the presidentâ€™s rule. otherwise also, it makes little difference if the state is ruled by rajnath or by advani. however, it provides time to the bjp and the bsp to work out modalities for the formation of a government. mayawatiâ€™s silence on gujarat carnage, endorsement of the governorâ€™s recommendation and decision to quit lok sabha are a clear pointer to a new political scenario in up. * * * * * * * * * * * ** * * ** ** * * * * the press under review has reacted to all these events on expected lines but with a restrain. while condemning the godhra muslims â€œif they are responsible for the carnage there on 2/3; the next day jadeed amal want to know as to how many cops have been punished for the negligence of duty in gujaratâ€�. rashtriya sahara (4/3), while wailing the pmâ€™s appeal for peace and not distinguishing between godhra and the rest of gujarat, urges all the right-thinking people to take steps to prevent the fire from spreading. sahafat (4/3), on the other hand is sharply critical of advani for providing a sort of justification for the mayhem by holding it as a reaction to godhra. * * * * * * * ** * * * * * * * * * * * * * * while gujarat is struggling to come to terms with itself, yet another, rather larger, inferno is waiting in the wings if all does not go well on march 15. this is not the time to refer to all that has been written about the vhp and its role, but of praying that reason has an upper hand on the sentiment on both the sides. however, it would be only apt to refer to rashtriya saharaâ€™s endorsement â€œof the pmâ€™s stand that â€œany decision in this regard will be taken only after taking parliament and the opposition into confidence.â€� * * * ** * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * the urdu press has expressed disagreement with the course adopted by the state governor regarding the formation of a new government. sahafat (8/3) holds that on the basis of the accepted parliamentary practice, the invitation to form a government to the bjp at the centre and the apex courtâ€™s judgment in the bommai case, the largest single party should have been given a chance to prove its majority in the houseâ€�. jadeed amal of the same day opines that â€œhad the situation been the opposite one, the governor would have taken the same decision which had been taken in regard to kalyan singh and mayawati. the in dinon disagrees with the governorâ€™s plank of stability. â€œit is none of his business and he should have invited the largest single partyâ€�, says the daily. rashtriya sahara is quite harsh on the â€œsecularâ€� parties, particularly the congress, for paving the way for the imposition of the presidentâ€™s rule.â€� all the dailies expressed shock at the tragic death of lok sabha speaker and paid rich tirbutes to the qualities of head and heart of the departed soul.",0,0,0,1,0

hyderabad: the all india babri masjid action committee (aimac) has accused the bjp of masterminding the on-going communal riots in various parts of the country to pave way for the transfer of disputed land to the vishwa hindu parishad (vhp). talking to reporters on saturday, aimac convener zafar yab jeelani said the riots were planned about two months ago by the bjp-led central government. â€œat the end of the chaitanya yatra from ayodhya to delhi by the vhp on january 27, prime minister atal bihari vajpayee has announced that the vhpâ€™s demand of transferring the disputed land has been referred to law minister arun jaitley. subsequently, the vhp leaders announced that they would start construction of ram mandir from march 15,â€� he said. jeelani said all those statements were made by the bjp and vhp leaders to polarise the voters during the assembly elections in uttar pradesh and other states. having lost the elections in all four states, the bjp then decided to transfer the disputed land by pressuring itself through the vhp by inciting communal violence.",0,0,0,0,0

ayodhya: chairman of ram janmabhoomi nyas (rjbn) mahant ramchandra paramhans das gave a new twist to the shila pujan programme by announcing that he will donate the carved pillars to the makeshift temple of ramlalla. this implies that the pillars will have to be received by the commissioner of faizabad division ak gupta, who is also the receiver of the makeshift temple and keeps a record of the donations made in the name of the presiding deity. the nonagenarian chief of digambar akhara has thus tried to draw the attention away from the march 15 shila pujan, which the vhpâ€™s working president ashok singhal says is still on. not only that, the move appears to be a ploy to get the pillars moved out of the workshop to the temple construction site by roping in the administration and thus avoid any confrontation. also, even if the symbolic puja is disallowed, the nyas would still have the stone pillars at the desired place. unless, of course, the statutory receiver decides to keep them at some other place. the paramhans, along with a few handpicked disciples from his akhara, began a five-day rudrabhishek and rudra yagya at the rjn workshop here on monday morning as a prelude to the â€˜pillar donationâ€™ programme. a number of vhp leaders, bjpâ€™s district unit office-bearers and supporters were present at the site. after completing the first part of rudrabhishek ritual and before starting the rudra yagya, paramhans spoke to mediapersons at the nyas workshop. he said; â€œi will shift the completely carved pillars of the proposed ram temple as a daan to the site of the temple for construction. these stones would be handed over to the statutory receiver of the acquired rjb complex, he added. the dharmacharya claimed that ramlalla had appeared in a dream in brahma muhurta and asked him to give all the carved stones as daan for the makeshift temple. â€œtherefore, i have decided to part with the stones on march 15. it will be given to ramlalla â€”- the presiding deity through the receiver.â€� while the vhp has everybody guessing about its real plan for march 15, it is anxiously awaiting the decision of the apex court to be pronounced on march 13. also, the meeting of the mandir nirman samiti - the highest body consisting of pro-temple sants - is scheduled to take place at karsewakpuram here on march 14. the final workplan for carrying out the â€œsanketik bhoomi pujaâ€� (symbolic worship) at the undisputed part of the acquired land will be approved at this meeting, sources close to highly-placed vhp leaders in ayodhya said. the latest move appears to be a ploy to involve the administration, in this case the commissioner in his capacity as receiver, to get the carved pillars out of the workshop and to the temple construction site. the move would ensure that there is no confrontation and even if the symbolic puja is disallowed the nyas still has the pillars in the desired place. unless, of course, the statutory receiver moves them to some other place.",0,0,0,0,0

""rama and lakshmana were born of different mothers but lived amicably aiding and assisting each other. so we are all children of bharat mata, why can''t we live in peace together?"" the seer wondered.

""permission diya jayega, koi taklif nahin hai,"" he claimed. ""though talks for the peace process have just begun, both the nyas and the muslim personal law board (mplb) have already agreed to abide by the supreme court''s verdict on this case. whatever happens next at ayodhya will be in accordance with the court''s decision. till the supreme court gives its ruling, status quo will be maintained at ayodhya. all people concerned have agreed to maintain peace in black and white, while discussions to resolve the issue are on,"" he said. the seer also called upon the masses to refrain from getting swayed by the vhp''s ""emotional outbursts.""

gandhinagar: the death toll in the worst-ever communal carnage in gujarat, starting with the godhra train burning incident on february 27, reached an all-time high of 726 on monday. the toll mounted so high amidst hectic preparations in the top corridors of power to face the two-day visit of the national minorities commission under the chairmanship of justice mohammad shamim starting march 13. the commission visits gujarat even as the state government finally managed to fulfil the national human rights commission order to send a preliminary report on the riots at the earliest. the figure of 726 includes the 60 who are reported dead in the gruesome train burning case. police sources gave these numbers here on monday, bypassing the strict secrecy prevailing over them. meanwhile, additional chief secretary (home) ashok narayan said, ""no list has been prepared of those missing."" not to predict how much the toll would ultimately reach or how many might be missing, he added, ""no new incidents are being reported. only bodies of those who died during the riots in the first few days are being compiled."" the national minorities commission members have requested the state government to arrange meetings with gujarat governor s s bhandari and chief minister narendra modi after it takes a round of certain riot-affected areas of the state on thursday. no final decision has been taken whether they will be allowed to meet the governor or the cm. justice shamim, it was officially told to the tnn, holds the rank of a union cabinet minister and has quasi-judicial powers to call top dignitaries. the state government''s interim report to the national human rights commission, sent on saturday, contains a sequel of events, giving reasons why the riots took place after the godhra train burning incident. the report, however, refuses to call the riots that followed in the state as a ""reaction"" to what happened at godhra, as many a ruling politician describes them. it suggests, whatever happened thereafter was an ""expected repercussion,"" though the state did not want them to happen. the report claims, as it had anticipated what was to come, the state government called para-military forces on february 27 itself. giving reasons for so many deaths during such a short duration, the report points out that this time the riots were more wide-spread than any time earlier. they took place in ahmedabad''s those areas which were never considered sensitive before. it does not believe there was any intelligence failure. the mobs were huge, yet the riots were controlled in the shortest duration.",0,0,1,0,0

ahmedabad: diamonds, textiles and chemicals sectors which constituted 88 per cent of gujarat''s total exports of rs 49,500 crore in 2000-01, have been severely hit by the recent riots. the diamond, gems and jewellery industry accounts for 50 per cent of the state''s total exports. this sector was just recovering from the september 11 terror attacks in the us. diamond exports were worth $652.50 million in january 2002 as against $520.20 million in january 2001, registering a growth of 25.43 per cent. ""diamond output was down by about 30 per cent during and after the riots. the industry has suffered a production loss of around rs 200 crore due to the riots,'''' said pravin nanavati, president of the surat diamond association. the industry could make up for the production loss by working overtime only if normalcy is maintained and employees are able to come to work. any prolonged disruption would hit export orders. petroleum products worth rs 6,400 crore constituted 12.9 per cent of gujarat''s exports in 2000-01. as these exports are from large companies like reliance petroleum, they are not expected to be affected. chemicals, pharmaceutical and plastics exports were of rs 6300 crore in 2000-01 and constituted 12.7 per cent of gujarat''s total exports. satish shah, gujarat region chairman of the basic chemicals, pharmaceuticals & cosmetics export promotion council (chemexcil), said the production losses in ahmedabad itself would be about rs 50 crore per day. ""in many chemicals the production is through batch processes and once a batch is discontinued it gets wasted completely and cannot be re-used. these losses are irrecoverable. companies will have to spend more money to run new batches to meet their export obligations,"" he explained. the textiles and garments industry had exports worth rs 5700 crore in 2000-01 and constituted 11.5 per cent of gujarat''s exports. the riots have caused losses of around rs 300 crore to the production and sale of fabrics manufactured in 18 textile mills and over 200 process houses and powerloom units. many are still closed as fear-stricken workers have left for their native places. except for the big textile units like arvind and ashima most of the other units had to keep their shutters down as workers did not report for duty for a week. the textile industry in surat which was recovering from its nearly month-long closure due to protests against high power cost is now faced with the riots. for long gujarat claimed to have ""least man-days lost among leading industrialised states in india and the highest productivity per employee/worker (alongwith maharashtra) in india"". but, this may not hold true today.",0,0,0,0,0

chandigarh:attempting a sociological explanation of the situation prevailing in strife-torn gujarat, renowned sociologist andre beteille said that on a larger scale, destabilisation takes place when society moves from a rigid hierarchical structure, where communities have an assigned status, to one where the structure is in a flux. â€˜â€˜however, i believe that a major factor at play is the growing attempt to raise temperature of relations between hindus and muslims as a result of political activity in uttar pradesh. the people responsible for this must attempt an explanation of what they expect,â€™â€™ said beteille. he said that it is not mere mob psychology and crowd behaviour at work, but a devious political leadership capitalising on an unfortunate rift between two communities. trying to understand why people in the country elect political leaders who in turn use the masses, beteille quoted ambedkar and said that democracy in india was only a top dressing on indian soil, which is essentially undemocratic. â€˜â€˜democracy is not merely a political system. more than that it is a social system.we have put in place a political system but do not have a commensurately evolved social system. it is this mismatch between the social and political systems which leads to large scale disruptions of the social fabricâ€™â€™. earlier speaking at the centre for rural research and industrial development at sector 18, beteille that the role of caste in politics had assumed a more important role than before. on a lighter note he said that in bihar only the â€˜â€˜mosquitoesâ€™â€™ do not exhibit caste discrimination and bite people of all castes. he said that if he had to delineate the most striking trend in indian society since freedom it would be the secular trend of increase in the age of marriage in women. he added that inter-caste marriages had become a part of arranged marriages. â€˜â€˜marriage choices have expanded and boundaries between sub castes and varnas have blurred.this is a trend which is moving from urban india towards rural indiaâ€™â€™. speaking on dowry, he said that earlier dowry was a characteristic social phenomenon prevailing amongst the rich while â€˜â€˜bride priceâ€™â€™ was the corresponding phenomenon amongst the poor. â€˜â€˜however, sanskritisation, where the lower strata aspired for the upper strata led to the infiltration of dowry amongst the poor along with an increase in the amounts involved. the black market in dowry is a grotesque form of social anomie and is a social pathological phenomenonâ€�, said beteille. beteille ended saying that inequality would always be there in some form or the other and that it was not desirable to have complete equality too. however, inequality should be regulated.",0,0,0,0,0

697,675,"after last sundayâ€™s electoral verdicts, congress leaders have started counting their states and biding their time, waiting to be kicked into power despite themselves. you donâ€™t need to be a psephologist to see that these election results were more than just a coincidence of electoral cycle, that there is a swing away from the ruling nda in all the four states. so, can the congress begin its countdown to power? iâ€™m not so sure. congresswallas would do well not to start counting their states too soon. for starters, they could ponder over some plain facts. one, while there is a swing away from the nda, there is no corresponding swing in favour of the congress. compared to the last lok sabha elections, the congress has also lost votes, and not just in up. yes, they won the elections in punjab and uttaranchal, but both these were technical victories rather than knock-outs. yes, they are likely to, or at least till three days ago looked likely to, add gujarat to the kitty next year. but can they retain this momentum when rajasthan, madhya pradesh, chhattisgarh and delhi â€” all the states ruled by the congress â€” come up for elections late next year? two, the congress at the moment is an also-ran in four of the biggest states in the country. bihar, up, tamil nadu and west bengal account for 201 seats in the lok sabha. in its present state, the congress would be lucky to win 20 of these seats. which means that it needs to win another 252 seats from the remaining 342, or three-fourths of the seats where it contends seriously, in order to reach the magical figure of 272 on its own. if the project of getting a majority on its own is not feasible, is the congress willing to enter into coalitions, say with the samajwadi party in up, the rjd in bihar and one of the dks in tamil nadu? is it ready to evolve institutional mechanisms for sharing power? three, all the surveys indicate that in most of the states the congress is still preferred by the underprivileged, the poor, the dalits, the lower obcs and minorities. but in the last few years the partyâ€™s ideological position on the economic policy has rarely betrayed a sensitivity towards the demands and needs of this section. perhaps, the bjp can afford to be gung-ho about privatisation and liberalisation, but this posture sits uneasily with the congressâ€™s social profile. what is the party going to do to bridge this yawning gap? what does it have to offer to its own potential voters? the fate of the congress depends on how it handles these three issues, and whether it can create an institutional dynamics to address these. ramamanohar lohia, the architect of anti-congressism, once said that the socialists lacked a â€˜â€˜will to powerâ€™â€™. three decades later, the same question now haunts the congress. does the congress have an institutionalised will to power? iâ€™m not for a moment doubting the congress leadersâ€™ insatiable desire for unlimited personal power. the point is: can they translate their personal ambitions into an institutionalised will?

bangalore: rss on sunday asserted that ayodhya had emerged as a core issue in the country and permanent peace can be achieved only after resolution of the dispute. ""ayodhya has become a core issue. everybody has to take it seriously. it cannot be brushed aside now"", rss joint general secretary and spokesperson madan das, said. ""for permanent peace, it is necessary to resolve the issue"", das told reporters at channenahalli, near here, where three-day meeting of the ""akhila bharatiya pratinidhi sabha"" (akps), supreme body of the rss, concluded on sunday. the ayodhya dispute could be resolved by any means - negotiation, through court or by passing resolution in parliament, he said, adding the disputed lands in kashi and mathura should be handed over to the hindus. rss'' ""akhila bharatiya karyakari mandal"" had on march 14 adopted a resolution, saying it considered the movement for the construction of sri ram''s temple on the ramjanmasthan at ayodhya as an expression of national aspiration of the people. it had also called upon swayamsevaks and like-minded hindutva-devoted workers to go to the people to enlighten them about the real issues and strengthen their resolve to continue the struggle in a peaceful and lawful manner till the goal of building a grand temple for sri rama at his janmasthan is fulfilled.

717,753,"new delhi: the prime minister turned down gujarat chief minister narendra modi's suggestion for a snap poll as he feels the state bjp's assessment that the communal polarisation, following the riots, could lead the party to victory is misplaced. bjp sources here said the violence has taken its toll on economic activity and has affected enough hindu businesses to neutralise the polarisation the state unit is talking about. two, if the state government seeks dissolution of the assembly, there is no guarantee the election commission would call elections soon enough for the party to ''benefit'' from such a polarisation. three, if elections are held soon, the assessment is that they would be so bloody they might be difficult to control. as a senior bjp leader put it rather euphemistically, ''if elections are held now, when tempers are running high, the mindsets would harden further.'' of course, the pm does not want to replace modi as yet for two reasons —he does not want to be seen to be acting under pressure from the opposition and with modi having become something of a ''hero'' in sangh circles, it is clearly not the right time to move him out. moreover, with the decisive rout of the bjp in the delhi civic polls and the cross-voting in the rajya sabha elections in karnataka, which saw the defeat of party candidate tharadevi siddharta, the bjp leadership feels it should not risk an election in gujarat. as things stand, it is rapdly disappearing from the political map: currently, it is only in power in gujarat, jharkhand and himachal pradesh. it was forced to dissolve the assembly in goa to check dissidence in its ranks. the bjp's relationship with its allies is not too happy either: in tamil nadu, the dmk has cut its ties with the bjp; in andhra pradesh, the tdp is hesitating to name its nominee for a successor to the late gmc balayogi, lok sabha speaker; in punjab, the akali dal is still sore that the bjp let it down in the recent assembly elections; in orissa, the biju janata dal is not happy with the way the bjp's sangh relatives in the vhp/bajrang dal stormed the state assembly. battered by electoral defeats, internal rifts and a record of poor governance —in some cases, criminal negligence, as in gujarat— the bjp will have a full agenda on its hands when its national executive meets in goa on april 12/13/14.

hyderabad: chief minister chandrababu naidu said on thursday that the ayodhya issue has become complicated as a result of its mishandling by political parties and religious leaders; therefore, it was time for leaders to put their heads together and arrive at a consensus on the issue in the larger interest of the nation. talking to reporters at ntr trust bhavan, naidu said the issue had been hanging fire for long but unfortunately, there had been no wholehearted effort by anyone to find a solution to it. naidu said the tdp had made it clear to the bjp that it would extend outside support to the government as long as it adhered to the common agenda of the national democratic alliance (nda). the chief minister said the political atmosphere in the country had become vitiated due to the ayodhya imbroglio. he observed that it was unfortunate that while all parties had stated that they would abide by the decision of the supreme court, their reaction to wednesday's verdict had been disappointing, each reacting differently. appealing to all political parties to support the supreme court judgement, he said the political situation in the country now was so sensitive that any development in ayodhya had a reaction in other parts of the country. parties should keep religion out of politics.",0,0,0,0,0

ahmedabad: the national commission for minorities (ncm) has come down heavily on the state government and the police for their inefficiency in curbing the riots that broke out after the burning of sabarmati express at godhra. an overriding sentiment implicit in a memorandum submitted to prime minister atal behari vajpayee by the ncm, stated that the minorities in gujarat have lost complete faith in the government, especially the police. it has requested the prime minister to immediately ensure that the faith of the minorities is restored in the police. the information came out during the visit of the commission, including chairman justice mohammad shamim and other members, who met both state governor sundar singh bhandari and chief minister narendra modi on thursday morning. they also heard grievances of the minority community members and visited some relief camps in the city. sources in the state government said the ncm has made several recommendations to the prime minister of which at least one has already been accepted. that equal compensation be given to both the victims of the train attack as well to the next of the kin of those killed in the riots that followed. one of the measures they have suggested to rebuild confidence among people is the government encouraging the creation of peace committees in sensitive parts on the city. the commission members have even gone to the extent of saying that those mohallas which have become ghettos and inaccessible to the government should be handed over to the red cross which would perhaps be more acceptable to the minorities. they have also demanded that composite committees be set up with representations from all walks of life, to survey the damage and decide on compensation. they are against only government officials doing the job because of the mistrust since the riots. because many minority community members are scared of taking treatment in the general hospital, they have recommended starting mobile hospitals, which can go into the affected areas and treat people in their own backyard. it would also like to see the government help doctors, volunteers and ngos who may come forward to help the riot-hit, as the minorities may prefer to deal with such persons in the given circumstances, rather than with the government. on the economic front, the commission would like the state government to direct banks to give soft loans on low interest rates so that small businessmen, shopkeepers and daily-wagers can regain their livelihood, destroyed during the riots. for those who have already taken loans before the riots started, ncm would like banks to waive the interest.",0,0,0,1,0

723,777,"new delhi: dravidian politics is at a crossroads. probably for the first time after the split in the early 1970s, both the dravidian parties together are supporting a government at the centre. â€˜â€˜dravidian politics in the formal sense is overâ€™â€™, says political scientist m s s pandian. â€˜â€˜of course, the ideas of the dravidian movement still resonate in the dalit movement and in certain feminist groups. but after ayodhya and gujarat, dravidian politics has completely lost its secularism, which was fundamental to its politics, as it flowed from its critique of religion from a rational point of view, rather than holding all religions in equal esteem.â€™â€™ some say it is the threat of the jail that has kept the dmk leadership with the bjp while another unspoken alliance is being worked out between jayalalithaa and the hindu munnani of the hindutva brigade. so while the bjp has a formal ally that calibrates its responses to ayodhya, it has an informal one that holds annadanam (feasts for the poor) at temples with bjp leaders as invitees. as if underlining this irony, dmk leader and former chief minister m karunanidhi split from the bjp at the state level on sunday, affirming full faith in prime minister vajpayee and praising him as an â€˜honestâ€™ man. the aiadmk had earlier voted along with the dmk for the prevention of terrorism ordinance here. karunanidhiâ€™s stand is not very different from union minister ram vilas paswan breaking ties with the nda in bihar. the dmk chief claimed that the local bjp is cosying up with the aiadmk and preferred not to mention the positive turnaround in bjp-aiadmk relations at the centre. according to informed sources, there was some tension in the just concluded dmk general council with karunanidhiâ€™s son, stalin, seeking a break with the bjp after the attorney generalâ€™s submission to the supreme court on ayodhya. these sources say union minister murasoli maran prevailed over his critics, forcing karunanidhi to remain within the nda. pandian blames the left parties as much as the two dravidian parties forâ€˜â€˜communalisation of dravidian politicsâ€™â€™. according to pandian, â€˜â€˜the aiadmk was always pro-hindutva. but the left found certain kind of secularist opportunism in jayalalithaa to form the secular front that has completely withered away in the last couple of months.â€™â€™

ahmedabad: non-life insurance companies in gujarat may have been hit severely by the communal riots over the past one month. but, the silver lining is the huge increase in awareness for insurance by business and household segments. industry sources say the month of march will be bad for all the four nationalised non-life insurance companies in gujarat. but, from april onwards, a major surge in new covers underwritten will happen in gujarat, according to senior non-life insurance officials. to capitalise on this surge in awareness, the new india assurance co ltd has advertised its householders insurance policy. other insurance companies are also expected to step up their campaign to convert this increased awareness into business. b sundara raman, the regional manager of new india assurance, said that selling insurance is difficult. ""we are selling tears and not dreams, which makes it difficult to convince our potential customers. over the last few years, natural calamities like floods, droughts and the earthquake have hit gujarat. due to this, the awareness for non-life insurance amongst all types of businesses as well as households is much higher in gujarat than in other states. he said the communal riots will act as a further impetus for many to take insurance cover. new india assurance's household insurance policy is over 10 years old. it offers insurance to the property as well as to household goods and domestic appliances in a house or a flat, said raman. r n ghelani, a manager at oriental insurance co, said that all four companies offer householders' insurance policy and a significant increase in business from this segment can be expected from april. ""insurance companies are now cautious about extending new covers for business and trade. new covers for businesses come into effect 15 days after the premium is paid. he said existing policies are being renewed for the same amounts and an increase in cover is generally not being accepted. many of the branches in curfew-bound areas are not functioning and many officers and agents are not able to function due to curfew. but, once normalcy returns, the growth in new business is expected to be very good, said ghelani. so far 3,913 claims worth rs 144 crore have been received by the four companies. new india assurance has got 1,025 claims (rs 33.85 crore), national insurance has 689 claims (rs 41.31 crore), oriental insurance has 973 claims (rs 29 crore) and united india insurance has 1,200 claims (rs 39.24 crore).",0,0,0,0,0

ahmedabad: last year, there was a different reason for not celebrating holi in gujarat. people generally remained indoor mourning the earthquake victims of the january 26 disaster. the festival on friday could be quite a damp affair this time, but it is the tension build-up in the air which is palpable. friday's holi has got the state on its nerves' edge. this year dhuleti is going to be a festival of different colours for gujarat — there will be the army's green battle fatigues, bright blue of the raf and the khaki of the other uniformed personnel, punctuating the lanes and the by-lanes leaving little chance for people to play as freely as they used to. the tension led to a bout of panic buying of essential commodities across the state on thursday evening, with residents fearing a fresh bout of violence, a month after the riots first began. with thousands of inflammatory leaflets threatening bloodshed on friday in circulation and rumours flying thick and fast, the state home department has decided to extend the curfew to more areas of the state. the ahmedabad police have strictly banned pillion-riding in the city. additional commissioner of police (special branch) pramod kumar said that male pillion riders would not be allowed on the road on friday. the ban on playing with colours, balloons and bulbs would also be in force. indefinite curfew would also be imposed in as many as 16 police station areas of the city, some of them as a precautionary measure. along the same lines, curfew has been clamped on certain areas of visnagar in mehsana where a mixed population resides. in vadodara, the police are likely to impose curfew in six police station areas. but in surat, police officers said imposition of blanket curfew could lead to panic. in rural vadodara, an army column was dispatched to the tribal-dominated bodeli region where the festivities are traditionally quite robust. while no extra reinforcements have been called for, the army and the bsf will patrol ahmedabad continuously on friday. on thursday, the army conducted a flag march in sarkhej where trouble broke out following incidents of arson. meanwhile, governor sunder singh bhandari has appealed to the people to create an atmosphere of mutual trust in society by celebrating the festival of holi-dhuleti with peace and simplicity. related stories",0,0,1,0,0
730,718,"new delhi: home minister l k advani recently met senior rss leaders to suggest that its agenda should evolve and grow. party sources said this did not mean abandoning hindutva, but rather looking for a vehicle other than the temple issue to take it forward. there were two reasons for suggesting a change: one, advani feels that the ayodhya issue no longer has the resonance after the destruction of the mosque and the construction of a makeshift temple. two, now that the bjp is in the government, it is too tricky an issue to handle â€” as a party in power, it has to abide by the constitution and the rule of law; as an rss-affiliate, it has to keep sangh members in good humour. the hunt is, therefore, on for an issue. in recent months, the party has toyed with terrorism and poto (prevention of terrorism ordinance). but as an rss source said: â€˜â€˜itâ€™s a good issue. but the problem is that it involves a country which is being supported by the us, and we cannot be seen to be taking a position critical of the us.â€™â€™ bjp sources added: â€˜â€˜we tried it in the recent uttar pradesh elections but it did not work.â€™â€™ the rss, during its recent pratinidhi sabha, mentioned the common civil code: rss sources said this issue, along with the rssâ€™s advice to muslims that their security depended on hindu goodwill, could become the subject of a countrywide campaign. the hunt is also on for a strategy to give the party a new look, as it gets into its last two years of this government. party managers are analysing the results of the four assembly elections, and there is widespread speculation that party president k jana krishanamurthy may be replaced by advani. but it is a suggestion which the pm has shot down repeatedly. the pmâ€™s detractors say he does not want advani to go because he does not want a parallel power centre. others point out that advani does not need to be a full-time party president to keep an eye on the organisation, and that he is, in any case, the partyâ€™s pointsman for the rss. after the recent polls, the need for a revamp of the party and the government has been felt. if some indication of the first is seen at the partyâ€™s national executive in april in goa, there could be a major reshuffle of the ministry after the budget session.

732,721,"new delhi: prime minister vajpayee and home minister advani were targeted in an attack launched against the nda government by congress president sonia gandhi in the lok sabha friday. charging the government with â€˜â€˜total ineptitudeâ€™â€™ and â€˜â€˜blatant support to bigoted forcesâ€™â€™, she accused the pm and his senior colleagues of conniving with the vhp on ayodhya issue and the gujarat government of complicity in the violence recently. participating in the debate on the motion of thanks to the presidentâ€™s address, the leader of opposition flayed the government for â€˜â€˜comprehensive collapse of governance at the centreâ€™â€™. referring specifically to the ayodhya issue, sonia said the centreâ€™s handling of the matter was â€˜â€˜shameful to say the leastâ€™â€™, adding that the pm and his colleagues did not display the requisite will to deal with the â€˜â€˜vhp blackmailâ€™â€™and took a â€˜â€˜u turnâ€™â€™ in the matter as it first asked the state governments to prevent volunteers from going to ayodhya and then gave instructions to provide them police protection. she attributed this somersault to the fact that several bjp mps wrote to the pm on march 7 threatening his government with â€˜â€˜dire condequencesâ€™â€™ if he did not fall in line with their demands. the duplicity of the government, she said, was further exposed through the attorney generalâ€™s stand on the ayodhya issue in the supreme court although people were made to believe that the pm and his government were neutral. turning to gujarat, sonia gandhi slammed the narendra modi government for its handling of recent violence in the state saying the â€œcomplicityâ€� of the government in the incidents stood thoroughly exposed. she was particularly critical of home minister advaniâ€™s reply to the debate on gujarat, stating that much of what he said was at variance with what they saw in the state. she wondered how advani had given a clean chit to the state government and congratulated himself for bringing the situation under control speedily even as gujarat was burning. holding the modi overnment guilty of derelection of its constitutional duties, sonia asserted that the continuance of such an â€œirresponsible and callousâ€� government in gujarat was an affront to the countryâ€™s secular polity while demanding that the judicial probe into the violence be conducted by a sitting judge of the supreme court. soniaâ€™s thirty-minutes speech, which was heard in pin-drop silence, went on to elaborate the nda governmentâ€™s failures on other fronts. regarding national security, she said there was â€œno evidenceâ€� of a clear-cut strategy on the part of the government on jammu and kashmir even as she lashed out at the pm for re-inducting george fernandes.

muzaffarpur: nationalist congress party''s national working committee member and former union minister, jagannath mishra, has strongly opposed his party''s central leadership''s decision to support poto bill in the joint session of the parliament, scheduled on tuesday, and openly praised the stand taken by congress president sonia gandhi which, he claimed, was aimed at protecting the nation and its secular structure. talking to newsmen here on monday, mishra disclosed that he has sent a fax message to ncp president sharad pawar, requesting him not to support poto bill. ncp is not a part of nda and, therefore, support to nda on a controversial and ""draconian"" bill is bound to be a suicidal step for ncp, he has warned. clarifying his apprehensions about the possible communal use of poto, he pointed out that the attempt of the gujarat government to use poto only against godhra accused and not against others responsible for killing of 1,000 people in that state, has exposed the intentions of the bjp. mishra brushed aside pawar''s plea that poto exists in a slightly another form of organised crime control act in maharashtra, karnataka and mp. he said he was in total disagreement with his party leadership on this issue. it was strange that the ncp brass had decided to back poto without taking the party working committee into confidence.",0,0,0,0,0

vadodara: the khaki uniform, the stars and the medals, the lathi and the bayonet, nothing seems to be evoking awe anymore in the people for the police force. the police force has seen a complete erosion in its authority in recent weeks despite rattling off statistics about how many rounds of fire and tear-gas shells it has used against the mobs. as gujarat remains scarred by a series of violent incidents since the godhra carnage, the state police seem to have lost its authority it controlled and also the faith the people had in it. so much so that even 20 days after the riots began, the mobs have no qualms about lynching their victims despite police cover given to them. the erosion of faith perhaps began on day-i itself, when an angry mob went on an assault and stabbing spree at the vadodara railway station on february 27 as the ill-fated sabarmati express chugged in in the evening even as 50 to 60 policemen, including grp, srp and city police personnel, watched. from then onwards, till sunday evening when an escort party of six policemen - three of them armed - virtually stood and watched a mob lynch two persons of the minority community and injure about 20, the image of the police has been on a downslide. says former city police commissioner jaspal singh, who is now with the samajwadi party, ""in this complete break-down of the law and order machinery, the image of the police has got so badly battered that mobs are now killing their victims right in the presence of these men who don''t have a leader left in the police force to inspire them."" ""the escort team was outnumbered by the mob that kept surging and swelling. they did resort to lathi-charge, but to no avail. we were left at the mercy of the mob,"" said an injured person. he was one of the people who had fled their houses in avdhootnagar in makarpura area of vadodara after february 28 and had returned to collect their belongings when the mob attacked. and, the aggrieved now cut across communities. if a mob comprising women from the minority community gheraoed vadodara police commissioner d d tuteja on ajwa road on sunday, a huge group of women took to the streets on saturday afternoon despite curfew, singing ram dhun and protesting police excesses on the menfolk of the salatwada area. two women were injured when the police had to burst tear-gas shells to disperse them. the lawlessness that gripped vadodara was also apparent when a group of tribals fired at the district collector and district superintendent of police recently when they on a round in kawant taluka. what has further dented the police''s image is the interference by the political class, with bjp functionaries being seen at a number of places, ""guiding"" policemen on the street on ""how and where to act"". and, the ram dhun singing crowds too, were virtually left untamed on friday. they meandered menacingly close to known sensitive areas and the policemen on duty did not act despite their provocative slogans that triggered fresh bouts of rioting last friday.",0,0,1,1,1

""from our observations, we feel that what happened in godhra was planned. and, what happened later, in a larger scale, was also planned. and, the planning was done at a higher level. it is also clear that whoever planned it had some political ends at sight and wanted to implement a political agenda. it was deliberate and a conspiratorial effort,"" said nayar, adding that ""till the chief minister is around, there cannot be peace."" ""the builders of our nation wanted to weave a fabric where everyone was a hindustani and where everyone fought together whether be it a social or economic cause. they wished to keep the state and religion separate. in gujarat, there was a deliberate effort to destroy this fabric,"" he said. zafar saifullah too hinted at a ""bigger plan, arranged in a big way"". ""it was meticulously planned, training imparted and targets identified. there was a think tank and there was a group that implemented the plan and the mastermind must be someone who wields lots of power,"" he said. calling the killings a calculated genocide, he said that the riots could not be a spontaneous reaction.

gandhinagar: at least 300 villages of jamnagar and kutch districts are likely to face water crisis this summer, as the ongoing work on the rs 400-crore drinking water pipeline from saurashtra branch of narmada canal has run into trouble following unexpected technical reasons in completion of the project. it is learnt that 500 mld of mahi waters were to reach jamnagar and its surroundings, and kutch by april 15 through the pipeline project undertaken by gujarat water supply and sewerage board, but a major problem of salinity ingress has cropped up in the canal lining work in surendranagar district from where the pipeline is passing. this has been a cause of worry for the board officials. though there is adequate drinking water stored in irrigation dams of saurashtra and kutch region, the ongoing project has run into trouble as a big stretch of at least 30-35 km needs to be protected through lining of tiles in lieu of conventional cement and concrete lining. according to reliable sources, 29 lakh tiles are required for the lining of the big stretch in surendranagar district but so far only three lakh tiles have been used for the canal lining work. ""and, with this slow pace, it will not be possible for the contractors to finish the work by the deadline of april 15,"" commented a senior government official on condition of anonymity. baffled by this bottleneck, the board officials have started consulting experts to overcome this problem, which would be time consuming unless some alternative is found. except this work, all other ancillary works including three falls to be created in surendranagar district are in full swing. at least 45 mw of power will be generated through these falls. the work for installation of powerful pumps is also in progress. the pumps will run round the clock at dholi dhaja dam, leading to consumption of 110 mw of power. the pipeline structure for the project is almost ready but for the pending lining work. the fate of the project is hanging in balance unless some technical solution was found out by technocrats. meanwhile, the state irrigation officials are confident that there is adequate water stored in dams of saurashtra and kutch and so there won''t be a grave drinking water crisis as was experienced last year. as compared to last year''s 40 mcm storage in saurashtra dams, the current storage is four times more - 170 mcm. in kutch region, the existing storage is around 35 mcm as against 12 in the corresponding period last year. as many as 42 irrigation dams in gujarat region has storage of 3,200 mcm as against 1,900 mcm last year. while confirming this, state irrigation secretary m s patel told tnn that there won''t be any serious drinking water crisis this year.

kanpur: giving a new turn to ayodhya controversy, president of the â€˜sakinsa mukti sangharsh samitiâ€™ bhantekarunakar on thursday claimed that there was neither a babri mosque nor a ram temple at the controversial site in ayodhya. he said that in fact it had been a holy place for buddhists and housed a â€˜saket bhuddha viharâ€™ â€” a holy place for the buddhist community. he also demanded an archeological survey of the controversial land to ascertain his claims. talking to reporters here on thursday, bhantekarunakar said that there were several historical evidences which confirmed a grand religious buddhist temple at the controversial site of ayodhya but members of other communities had grabbed land and were making their own claims to misrepresent history. â€œnow, it will be the responsibility of the union government and apex court of the country to make buddhist leaders party to the ongoing case between the ramjanam bhumi nyas and babri masjid action committee,â€� he added. making scathing attacks on members of the hindu and muslim communities for trying to grab the religious place of the buddhists, bhantekarunakar claimed that hindus had not only grabbed buddhist religious places at ayodhya and bodhgaya but also installed idols of their god and goddess. muslims too had constructed mosques at several places by destroying historical places of worship of the buddhist community. not only this, members of these communities had made several efforts to destroy buddhist monument â€˜sankinshaâ€™ in farrukhabad in which hundreds of religious heads were killed. even then initiative had been taken on the part of the government to resolve the issue. â€œfrequent attack on buddhist religious heads and illegal possession of their holy places had sparked off resentment among the community members,â€� he said. the buddhist leaders would now be mounting pressure on the government to provide possession of buddhist places of worship. in this connection, leaders throughout the country will take part in a national-level meeting to be held in the city on march 17.",0,0,0,0,0

mumbai: gujarat chief minister narendra modi in an exclusive interview to the times of india says his state is returning to normalcy. excerpts from the interview.in your view, was the burning of 58 kar sevaks in the sabarmati express at godhra a planned attacked or a spontaneous one? was there an untoward incident on the station platform which sparked the attack?if one looks at the nature of the heinous attack on the sabarmati express and the manner in which 58 innocent kar sevaks were burnt alive in a compartment of the ill-fated train, it would be apparent that it was a deep rooted conspiracy and a pre-planned, cold-blooded attack.the train arrived at godhra at 7:43 a.m. and within five minutes, i.e. at 7:48 a.m., it left godhra. it was stopped at signal falia about 500 metres away and a mob attacked the compartment collectively. how can such an attack be spontaneous? moreover, the train departed from faizabad and arrived in godhra after 36 long hours, and no incident was reported on the behaviour of the kar sevaks en route. but the president of the gujarat unit of the congress, amarsinh chaudhary, has alleged in a television interview that the attack took place because the kar sevaks did not pay money for a cup of tea at the railway station. is it not ridiculous to justify a ghastly incident such as this?there are reports that the tableegi jamiat of the deobandi school of islam has been fanning fundamentalist ideology in godhra and that there were instances of members of the majority community being burnt in the past few years. are these reports true? if so, on what dates were they burned and by whom and what is the action taken against the persons concerned?the long history of communal violence in godhra is not an unknown phenomenon, but it has taken an ugly and serious turn in the last 25-30 years. two families have been burnt alive in the same area in the past in a ghastly incident. and ten years ago, four teachers, including two women teachers, were mercilessly cut to death in a school in the presence of children.while the then congress rulers have registered court cases in a routine manner, they have failed miserably to punish the real culprits. not only this, the main culprit named asaraf was done to death while in a jail by other accused persons and the whole event was pushed into a corner forever.reports of the violence in ahmedabad give the impression that it was well organised. the reports said armed mobs went around with voting lists targeting muslims. an ias officer, harsh mander, has given a chilling account of the violence in ahmedabad. why has the state not been able to tackle the situation? there are allegations that the police was partisan. please comment.those who are acquainted with gujarat know that this state is very sensitive to communal violence. there have been serious communal disturbances triggered by petty and minor incidents relating to kite flying or a cricket match. in the past, communal violence has broken out in 200 places at a time and curfew has been imposed in about 300 villages and towns for months together.compared to this, the godhra massacre was unparalleled in history, but we took all proactive measures to curb the violence within 72 hours. the police fired more than 3,900 rounds initially and the army was airlifted from the border area and deployed within 16 hours in the disturbed areas. there was no complacency on the part of the government or the police.even now the situation doesn''t seem to be under control. what is the reason for this?there are about 18,000 villages in the state, of which disturbances were reported in no more than 50 villages. of the 242 municipal towns in the state, incidents took place in less than 40 towns. after march 3, no major incidents of violence have been reported. not only this, religious rituals were observed on the eve of holi in all 18,000 villages in a peaceful manner, while moharrum was observed with tazia processions at more than 1,000 places. ten lakh students have appeared in the ssc\hsc examinations and the process of village panchayat elections is going on in a peaceful manner in about 1,700 villages.lakhs of pilgrims are on padyatras to reach dakor yatradham for the full moon day celebrations and in palitana, a famous jain pilgrim centre, lakhs of jain families are coming in from far-off areas. even in ambaji in north gujarat, thousands of pilgrims have come together for prayers. does this not suggest peace and normalcy in the state?there are allegations that you have moved out police officers who took a tough stance against the rioters. please comment.again, this is a false and misconceived allegation. the issue of promotions of police officers was long pending and it was purely an administrative decision. there was absolutely no political motive in the transfers of officers. those who are indulging in false propaganda are only damaging the morale of the forces.do you think that a section of the bjp itself is behind the campaign for your removal?i am getting unequivocal support from all the bjp workers and leaders of the state. they have been a constant source of encouragement and inspiration for my government''s fight against terrorist and anti-social activities. i am committed to protecting the people of gujarat. the talk of internal bickering is baseless and mischievous.is it true that you are in favour of mid-term elections in gujarat?it is unfortunate that when my entire focus as a leader of the state is to provide relief to all those who have been affected, such issues are being raised. my sole concern today is to bring total normalcy to my state and to create an atmosphere of mutual trust and harmony. in this grave period, i do not have any time to think of any political activity.two of your ministers are reported to have been in the ahmedabad police control room when the riots broke out in ahmedabad. what action do you plan against them?it has always been a tradition in this state for senior ministers to monitor and coordinate the rescue and relief measures from the control rooms. this is treated as a routine and regular exercise. during the earthquake, ministers were actively coordinating the relief activities from the police control room. i feel distressed to see that this also is being twisted by the media, with the sole objective of maligning my government.related storiesÂ low key holi in gujaratÂ violence continues in central gujarat  ",0,0,1,0,1

lucknow: president of the minorities forum of india and samajwadi party mla azam khan slammed the rashtriya swayamsevak sangh and other pro-hindutva outfits for the intemperate language being used for muslims and said it was part of a pre-designed plan to create a sense of terror among them. he demanded that a debate should be held in parliament on why hindus and muslims could not live together and, if the anti-muslim stance of these organizations were allowed to continue, where exactly the muslims were to go and live. addressing a press conference, khan said the recent statement of the rss that if the muslims had to live here they would have to win the goodwill of the majority community and the earlier statements of the prime minister and bharatiya janata party leaders regarding the minority community were aimed at insulting and launching a pre-planned hit campaign against them. he said the time had come for the state to decide if the vishwa hindu parishad was the representative of the entire hindu community. citing the case of godhra and the recent happenings in ayodhya, the sp mla said the central theme in all of them was the babri mosque and reiterated that the question of giving up the babri mosque did not arise. he said the babri mosque should be treated as the check point and if the government failed on this count the day was not far when nothing would prevent the country from disintegrating. khan said while the muslims were willing to adhere to the court verdict it had now become necessary not to restrict the movement to the court alone. the time had come to make the people aware of the actual issue, he added. khan said he had demanded the setting up of a special court for the godhra incident with a fixed timeframe of one month, but the government had not heeded to his view point. referring to the attack on the orissa assembly, he said it was ironical that those who attacked parliament were termed terrorists and those who did the same in orissa were dubbed desh bhakts and no action was taken against them. khan said it was another proof of the bharatiya janata partyâ€™s doublespeak. on the plan to implead the central government in the ayodhya case, the sp mla said it was a welcome step as the stand of the government on the issue would become clear.",0,0,0,1,0

mumbai: satish sahney, who was mumbai''s police commissioner from november 1993 to november 1995, is widely credited as the man responsible for applying the healing touch to the city after the communal riots of 1992-''93, which were followed by the serial blasts in march 1993. in the backdrop of the recent gujarat violence, he explains how he put the police-muslim relationship on an even keel. excerpts from an interview:what were the conditions like when you took over as mumbai police commissioner?the two communities were never so divided as they were in 1993. police credibility was at its lowest, particularly among the muslims. they were not willing to even take a complaint to the police, which is a very dangerous situation.what steps did you take to improve the situation?soon after i took over, i started a direct dialogue with constables. my thrust was: you have lost the trust of the people and unless you take the initiative the situation will not remedy automatically. i would visit police stations and the point i sought to drive home in every meeting was, `do you feel satisfied about a situation in which a sizeable section of the citizenry views you as partisan and people feel that your decisions are based on your religion and not on your training or on your allegiance to the constitution?'' i used to implore the constables that once they donned the police uniform, they had no caste, no creed and that they had to deal with people as those who break the law and those who abide by it.what kind of response did you get from the constables?initially, i used to get very little response because constables are not used to this sort of an exercise. but gradually, i found that they were becoming aware of the fact that they were being targetted for being partisan. the issue is of sending the right signals. all said and done, the indian police looks up to its leadership; the moment policemen know that the chief wants work to be done the way it should be done they fall in line. but if the leader is not clear in his thinking then things can go wrong. how did you go about bridging the communication gap between the police and the citizens?reaching the people was a more difficult exercise. fortunately for me, julio ribeiro returned to the city in april 1994 and teamed up with sushobha barve of the moral rearmament army who was active in the restoration of peace. they had a lengthy discussion with my men and we decided to initiate a dialogue with the aggrieved people. the first meeting was held in a mahim school with a group of 20 well-educated muslims. for nearly three hours we just listened to some very angry people. i had some idea of the intensity of their feelings but some of their statements were very provocative; they had come to the conclusion that the exercise was an eyewash. yet, we kept our cool.three days later, there was another meeting at mahim with another set of muslims. this meeting, too, stretched for three hours but the hostility was much lesser, the anger that used to show on their faces was absent. the third meeting, again at mahim, was exclusively with women. it was here that i first spoke out; i told them that i had not come to defend what had happened, my purpose was to ensure that such things would never happen again. for this, i needed their support. finally, it registered with the muslims that we were not being superficial.so, merely hearing out the aggrieved people helped you establish a rapport?what helped in changing the hard attitude of the people was that we allowed them to unburden themselves. from our side, we did not use a harsh word nor did we try to put them in their place. it has been my experience all through my police career that if you give a patient hearing to a man who has come with a grievance and allow him to unburden himself, quite a lot of his bitterness and anger goes away. you may not be able to do much because of legal constraints or procedural requirements, but that you gave him a patient hearing and allowed him to speak out without bullying him makes a big change in that person''s attitude.did you make amend the police functioning in any way as a result of the interaction at mahim?one of the complaints that the women had was that during any bandobust or festival, the police would routinely pick up all the young boys in the locality and lock them up for a day in the name of preventive detention. i assured them that not one person without a criminal record would ever betouched.how did you manage such productive interaction in communally sensitive localities all over the city?like sushobha, there were others, such as p.p. jamkhedkar in behrampada and bhau korde in dharavi, who had taken the initiative to restore peace in their localities. these people were instrumental in making the meetings possible. and it was at these meetings that the concept of mohalla committees emerged.how are your mohalla committees different from the earlier ones, which had worked wonders in bhiwandi?in the bhiwandi model, the police created and led the mohalla committees. our mohalla committees were people''s organisations. the informal leader of each mohalla committee is an apolitical person who has some standing in the area. he is the one who convenes the meeting, not the local police. the mohalla committee has no structure and no one gets any identity cards; these are just a bunch of citizens respected by the local police.did the police support mohalla committees just because you happened to be the commissioner?that must have helped, but the sub-inspectors and inspectors also realised that without public support their work would become very difficult in a big city like mumbai. at that time the inspectors were conscious of the fact that they were not being trusted by the muslim community and it rankled in their minds. hence, they were also willing to accept this principle of a partnership between the community and the police. mohalla committees basically brought citizens together to tackle their problems. at places the work of mohalla committee became so effective that the police station was willing to let them handle some minor matters.

763,826,"new delhi: law minister arun jaitley on saturday defended the government''s action in deputing a senior pmo official to ayodhya to receive the shila, saying the government had merely performed the role of a facilitator. intervening in a discussion on ayodhya in lok sabha, he said that attorney general soli sorabjee''s arguments in the supreme court for allowing puja were not at the behest of government. he said that the acceptance of the shila by the officer was not against the secular character of the country. jaitley said that civil service officials were deputed to religious institutions and referred to sending of official delegations for haj and appointment of administrators for tirupati temple. he said that in 1989 shilanyas was performed with the blessings of the then congress government. defending attorney general soli sorabjee''s action, he said ""attorney general interprets on his own and not on behalf of the government and does not accept instructions from the government."" quoting the constitution, jaitley said that it was clearly laid down that the attorney general was independent of government and appeared in courts on its behalf.

764,828,"new delhi: the day after. the vhp is happy despite the mounting dissatisfaction of the kar sewaks who feel let down by their parent organisation. not so for the vhp. â€˜â€˜after the opening of the temple locks in february 1985, and the shila nayas ceremony later, this is the first time the central government has accepted in principle that the ram temple will be constructed at the disputed site only and not on the acquired land,â€™â€™ says praveen togadia, vhpâ€™s international general secretary. the fact that the prime ministerâ€™s ayodhya cell chief shatrughan singh has personally accepted the - on behalf of the government - from mahant paramhans, has been interpreted to mean that â€˜â€˜the indian state has agreed in principle that the mandir will be constructed at the site where the make-shift temple is at the moment,â€™â€™ he says happily. what does the man in the muddle have to say about the role he was called upon to play in the ayodhya imbroglio? while shatrughan singh, the prime ministerâ€™s special emissary entrusted with the role of receiving the shila at the vhpâ€™s shila daan ceremony, prefers to maintain silence, sources close to him say the low-profile bureaucrat is not a happy man today. first, because he had no say in the matter and was arbitrarily pushed into the field without prior notice. second, because this was hardly the role he had envisaged for himself as chief of the ayodhya cell in the cabinet secretariat. singh was cast in this role, scripted by the vhp leadership, at the last minute after late night telephonic-exchanges between vajpayee, l k advani and paramhans on march 14. he was merely put on the flight and asked to do the needful in ayodhya, no questions asked. did he have a choice? â€˜â€˜not really, if he wanted to keep his job,â€™â€™ says a source in the pmo. ironically, even though he headed the ayodhya cell, singh figured nowhere in the negotiations between the kanchi shankaracharya and the all india muslim personal law board. in the high political drama, last fortnight, it was sudheendra kulkarni, osd in the pmo, who was the master of ceremonies, sources point out. this naturally added to singhâ€™s pique. pmo sources say that the vhp had specifically asked for singhâ€™s services for three reasons. one, as divisional commissioner of faizabad till february last year, he knew most their leaders. two, the vhp were unwilling to accept the shilas from the present commissioner, a k gupta, who they felt was hostile to their cause. but most importantly, by getting singh to receive the pillars, the vhp would be able to obtain the centreâ€™s seal of approval to the temple construction in ayodhya, strengthening their case in the future. was this senior administrative officer comfortable with the role thrust upon him? there are many in the bureaucracy willing to jump to singhâ€™s defence. â€˜â€˜anyone who watched him go through the rites like a robot would be in no doubt that he was not exactly enjoying the job,â€™â€™ says a up bureaucrat. adds another, â€˜â€˜when it comes to hogging the limelight, politicians are forever ready, but for something as controversial as shila puja or shila daan, it is attorney generals and bureaucrats who are called upon to be the sacrificial lamb.â€™â€™

lucknow: putting up brave face to keep the ram temple movement alive, the vishwa hindu parishad has given broad hints to withdraw the undertaking given to the centre, which says the vhp and the ram janambhoomi nyas will abide by the supreme court verdict on the ayodhya case. â€œthe undertaking has lost its relevance after kanchi seer jayendra sarswatiâ€™s formula failed to take off,â€� stated rajendra singh pankaj, vhp joint secretary. the vhp leader claimed that the undertaking to the centre was conditional and was given only for implementation of jayendra saraswatiâ€™s formula to defuse ayodhya crisis, but the formula was rejected by the all-india muslim personal law board on march 10. â€œno formula no undertakingâ€� seems to be the mood in the vhp camp as all its leaders are changing track after facing wrath of ram sevaks after march 15 climbdown on â€˜shila daanâ€™ programme. rjn chairman mahant ramchandradas paramhans, who had resolved to abide by the march 13 supreme court verdict, has changed his tone, too. â€œhow can i accept court verdict against temple construction after fighting the case for over 50 years?â€� asked paramhans. firebrand bjp mp vinay katiar is of the opinion that ram temple is a question of faith and in matters of faith courts have limited role to play. â€œwhen religious sentiments are involved, courts should avoid any intervention,â€� he commented. the bjp mp, who had played an active role in defusing the situation in ayodhya on march 15, quoted a few judgments of the courts which were not followed as public sentiments were deeply hurt. â€œthe issue can never be resolved through the courts of law. serious negotiations have to be started again to settle the dispute amicably. if courts decide the case, the judgment will hurt the feelings of members of the loser community and the dispute will go on,â€� reasoned katiar. significantly, the undertaking given to the centre was not signed by the rjn chairman paramhans. in fact, the mahant had distanced himself from the saraswati formula and had refused to sign the undertaking when talks were on in delhi in second week of march. it was the vhp working president ashok singhal who had to sign the undertaking in the capacity of rjn managing trustee. â€œthe undertaking has no legal standing as only rjn chairman (mahant paramhans) is authorised to sign it,â€� quips a vhp functionary. the issue to withdraw the undertaking had come up for discussion during a high-level meeting of vhp office-bearers at karsevakpuram on saturday. chaired by ashok singhal, the meeting was attended by acharya giriraj kishore, rajendra singh pankaj, purshottam narain singh, champat rai, dharminder dwivedi and others. a senior state vhp leader disclosed that it was decided during the meeting that since the undertaking given to the centre had no relevance now, it should be withdrawn. â€œwe will be forwarding a letter to the centre in this regard soon,â€� claimed the leader.",0,0,0,0,0

mumbai: a parcel containing signalling flares exploded and hit the ceiling of rajkot airport early on saturday morning during a security check, moments before it could be loaded onto a jet airways flight for mumbai. no one was injured. jet''s general manager for security a.s. bedi confirmed the incident. an aviation security official said if the flares had exploded during the flight, it could have had disastrous consequences. there were nearly 100 mumbai-bound passengers on board. according to the airline''s officials here, the parcel, booked by a kandla-based shipping firm, contained seven small and four large flares, which are usually released by a ship''s captain when the vessel is in distress. inquiries made by tnn showed that neither the kandla-based jaisu shipping corporation, the owners of the flares, nor its affiliate in mumbai, kalba marine services private limited, which was to receive the consignment, were prepared to accept responsibility for trying to airfreight the parcel without informing the airline. jet officials said the flares were brought to rajkot airport by an agent of the firm at about 5 a.m. to book them as cargo on the flight scheduled to take off at 7.20 a.m. the agent opened the box to allow jet''s security staff to check the contents. at that moment, one of the flares exploded and hit the ceiling close to the main porch of the terminal building. the box was immediately isolated and the flight left for mumbai on schedule. jet officials alleged that jaisu shipping corporation had failed to declare that it was air freighting the flares, which was a serious offence. they cited the rules framed both by the bureau of civil aviation security (bcas) and the directorate general of civil aviation, which have classified the items as dangerous goods. the firm''s manager at kandla, rajesh vaswani, blamed the courier firm which had booked the items for not informing the airline.

hyderabad: the criticism of the vajpayee-led nda-government at the centre by different sections over the enactment of prevention of terrorism act (pota) notwithstanding, former union law minister ram jethmalani supported the act saying that â€œit will prevent a majority of the people from committing crimeâ€�. â€œthe draconian provisions incorporated in the law will keep the moderates away from the path of terrorism,â€� jethmalani said. brushing aside contention that pota would be misused the same way as tada was, he said such interpretations of the act were misleading. â€œno criminal law in the country was able to totally eradicate crime. but, despite having draconian provisions, acts like pota will act on the sub-conscious of the wavering majority and prevent them from taking to criminal ways,â€� he said in the defence of the controversial act. participating in a meet-the-press programme organised by the ap union of working journalists (apuwj) on sunday, the controversial jurist, however, admitted that the act could be misused and a glaring example of this is the arrest of yasin malik in srinagar a couple of days ago. â€œa woman was found with dollars and carrying dollars is not an offence. but, still she was arrested,â€� he said. jethmalani, always in the news for taking up cases like defending the case of indira gandhiâ€™s assasinators, also affirmed that he told union home minister l k advani that â€œhe would make the life of the government miserableâ€� if any case of misuse of pota is sighted. on the misuse of tada, he said that the act was used against the innocents due to the lack of strength of character on the part of the law enforcement agencies who acted as puppets of the political masters in-charge. hence, he suggested constitution of a monitoring group on the reports of pota misuse and expressed willingness to constitute teams of lawyers in the areas where the act is likely to be misused to offer free services to the innocents. â€œthe misuse of pota can be prevented by a sensitive judiciary, vigilant press and necessary legislations,â€� he said. supporting the enactment of the pota, he said that the act was necessary in view of the high degree of sophistication achieved by the terrorist outfits. â€œnobody ever dreamed that bin ladenâ€™s al-qaeda will destroy the american structures using its own instruments. it is now an established fact that the terrorist outfit has a wide-spread network throughout the world and i have no doubt that our country also has the pockets of influence,â€� he said, adding it is in the context, the godhra carnage which resulted in the death of several innocent people should be understood. he observed that perpetrators of the godhra massacre knew that there would be retaliation which would lead to suffering of both the majority and minority communities. â€œwhoever had done that were not the friends of islam or muslims, but only wanted to create chaos in the country by striking terror among innocents. â€œthe vajpayee government has earned marks for its foreign policy for neutralising pakistanâ€™s designs. but the reputation of the country has suffered because of the gujarat incidents,â€� he said. on the ayodhya issue, jethmalani said that the demolition of the mosque was tragic and it constituted a criminal offence, besides being inconsistent with the ethos of the country. â€œthe whole controversy surrounding the temple issue is a futile one,â€� he said.",0,1,1,0,0

gandhinagar: who was responsible for application of poto in cases pertaining to the accused in the godhra train massacre? while the government on friday decided to defer the application of poto in the case of the 62 persons arrested in godhra for the attack on sabarmati express on february 27, questions still persist about whose idea it was to impose poto in the first place and why did the government subsequently go back on the decision. interestingly, when asked for his comments on whose idea it was to use poto , the chief minister narendra modi said, ""may be some local policeman might have thought of it"". interestingly, it was the chief minister who had described the godhra incident as an act of terrorism . there are various theories floating around on why the government actually withdrew poto from the godhra case. while the government has stated that it was done following legal opinion by the advocate general , others believe that it was done at the insistence of the prime minister''s office, following pressure from the nda allies. there is also the belief that the modi developed cold feet on poto because he felt that he may have to use the same ordinance against the post-godhra rioters also. however, one reason why the gujarat government may have decided to withdraw poto is that so far no concrete links have been found between them and organised terrorist groups such as the lashkar-e-toiba and the jaish-e-mohammad. minister of state for home, gordhanbhai zadaphia, told tnn here on saturday that though ""some evidence exists"" about the involvement of the accused with those instigating cross-border terrorism, including isi, ""these have yet to be authenticated."" but zadaphia said, investigations are on, and poto can be applied any time within three months after the charge sheet is issued. ""for that, one has to prove that those involved have been party to organised terror. but i see nothing wrong in lifting the poto"", he clarified. ""different ipc sections, including the ones applied on those responsible for mass killings, are strong enough to book those responsible. conviction will be as good as poto."" sources further said pressure from several quarters was indeed quite strong on the cm to withdraw poto. the national human rights commission, which was here on a three-day visit, had also raised serious objections to it. circles close to the cm, however, take a different view. according to them, the decision to apply poto was that of the investigating officers. the decision to make poto effective in gujarat was taken on march 1, 36 hours after the gruesome tragedy had taken place.

ahmedabad : the sudden spurt in gujarat state fertilisers and chemicals ltd (gsfc) stock price has come as a big surprise. gsfc''s stock price posted a new annual high of rs 23.75 on the bse on march 22. the question now is why should the stock move up when the company has reported a net loss of rs 55 crore for the first nine months of current fiscal year and is expected to post large losses for the entire year? on march 22, the day gsfc''s stock recorded a new high, an advertisement for sale of gsfc''s 45 mw captive power plant appeared in a leading financial daily. sources said that while gsfc is looking at a price of rs 120 crore plus from this sale, the actual sale may materialise at about rs 100 crore. gsfc''s managing director, balwant singh, did not specify about when the deal would take place. but, some sources say that the advertisement is only for meeting regulatory requirement and the actual sale may have been already finalised. whether the sale happens before march 31 or it gets done in next fiscal year, the bottomline is an extraordinary income (gross) of about rs 100 crore for gsfc. if it were to happen in this fiscal year, then the company would be able to post a net profit by offsetting its losses with this extraordinary income. the movement in gsfc''s stock indicates that one or more stock market operators might have got to know about the power plant sale before the advertisement on march 22. gsfc''s stock price on the nse jumped to rs 20 on march 21 from rs 16.65 the previous day and touched its new annual high of rs 23.25 on march 22. similar trend was noticed on the bse too. gsfc''s stock had touched its all time low of rs 9 on the bse on september 17, 2001. the 45-mw power plant was commissioned in 1994. it has been lying unutilised for some time as it was originally set up to fuel the third caprolactum plant according to sources. with this project being abandoned, gsfc has no need for the power plant. for the nine months ended december 31, 2001, gsfc''s net sales were down at rs 1464 crore as against rs 1510 crore in previous year''s nine months. the net losses in current nine months were higher at rs 55 crore as against rs 38 crore in previous nine months. gsfc had to make an extraordinary charge of rs 9.9 crore in current nine months towards additional water charges payable to ioc. in fiscal 2000-01, gsfc managed to cover up a huge losses through some creative accounting. it post a net profit of rs 6 crore by adjusting against its reserves the recovery dues of rs 210 crore from the fertilisers industries coordination committee. gsfc''s net profits have been declining over the last six years, from rs 206 crore in 1995-96 to rs 6 crore in 2000-01.",0,0,0,0,0

ahmedabad: the bjp in the state is on the horns of a dilemma. the party does not know whether to press for an early assembly election to derive political mileage out of the current perceived pro-hindutva wave. political observers feel that since the bjp government, headed by chief minister narendra modi, has ordered postponement of municipal elections for a period of three months ""on the grounds of deteriorated law and order situation,"" it would be difficult to go for a snap poll. the central leadership of the party is now busy with the ayodhya crisis and it seems that it is not in a hurry to contemplate over the proposal for fresh elections in gujarat at this stage. however, a majority of the senior leaders are of the opinion that the government should seek the leadership''s permission to hold elections as the atmosphere in the state is in favour of the saffron brigade as was never before in past four years. ""the bjp, which suffered heavily following its debacle in almost all the bye-elections in the past two years, is likely to be benefited in the changed circumstances,"" a source said. but on the other hand, prime minister atal behari vajpayee, who is annoyed with the state leadership, has already indicated in new delhi that elections in the state would be held only as per the schedule. vajpayee has conveyed this to a delegation of the opposition parties which had called on him to discuss the issue of communal violence. meanwhile, the state leadership is stunned by vajpayee''s announcement in new delhi that a state-level committee, headed by the governor, would be constituted to supervise the relief camps in ahmedabad. the announcement is perhaps spurred by the complaints of discrimination levelled by the opposition leaders against the government, mainly in the supply of essential commodities to riot victims. however, a senior minister said the decision was taken only after consultation with chief minister modi. in another development, some senior ministers and party leaders have been dispatched to various parts of the state to make an on-the-spot assessment of the present situation. state health minister ashok bhatt will make an assessment of central gujarat, while finance minister nitin patel would submit a report on north gujarat. agriculture minister purshottam roopala and urban development minister i k jadeja would be in charge of the saurashtra region. ""the people in the state have been badly influenced by the heinous attack on ram sevaks in sabarmati express and feel that the bjp regime alone could protect them in such communally charged atmosphere,"" a minister told tnn on condition of anonymity. the party will decided the future course of action only after the assessment reports are received by the end of this week. on the basis of this reports, a formal proposal might be prepared and forwarded to the party president jana krishnamurthi.",0,0,0,0,0

vadodara: the additional supply of power from madhya pradesh, chhatisgarh and maharashtra has helped the gujarat electricity board (geb) ease restrictions on the use of power by industries and rural areas in the state. geb has extended the period of lifting restrictions on the use of power by non-continuous processing industries in the state to april 8 from march 25. with the wheat season getting over, the demand for power from the farm sector in madhya pradesh has considerably gone down. moreover, there is no heavy demand from the industries either which has resulted in the availability of surplus power. this coupled with the cash-starved madhya pradesh state electricity board, which will find it difficult to pay for drawing more power from national thermal power corporation (ntpc). chhatisgarh, a power surplus state, too has no problem in supplying more power to gujarat. even maharashtra state electricity board is facing a cash crunch and has restricted power procurement from ntpc. all these factors have worked in favour of gujarat which enables the state to draw up to 500 mw of additional power from the central sector units. so geb, which is facing the acute problem of capacity shortage due to increased demand for power, is in favour of drawing additional power from ntpc units. with the onset of summer, the unrestricted demand for power has gone up to more than 8,500 mw in the state.",0,0,0,0,0

mumbai: â€œin the punjab we have 55,000 soldiers and large-scale rioting on our hands. in bengal our forces consist of one man, and there is no rioting.. may i be allowed to pay my tribute to the one boundary force..â€™â€™ wrote lord mountbatten to mahatma gandhi on august 26, 1947. at a time when brutal massacres and despicable politicians crowd the headlines, this letter is a wrenching reminder of how one man averted a communal bloodbath during the partition. the then 77-year-old gandhi skipped the official celebrations in delhi and, instead, opted to welcome independence by fasting in a ramshackle shelter in kolkata. his mere presenceâ€”and mastery over the tools of non-violenceâ€”brought peace to that volatile city. this was perhaps gandhiâ€™s greatest legacy, but it is the one we have chosen to ignore. â€œin 1940, when asked what he would choose to do if india gained freedom during his lifetime, gandhi answered that he would try to organise the country along nonviolent lines,â€™â€™ says prominent historian b.r. nanda, adding that communal harmony was the mahatmaâ€™s overriding concern. â€œthe recent events in gujarat demonstrate how little we have understood his vision and methods.â€™â€™ few people, of course, know gandhi better than his dedicated biographer. over the last 50 years, mr nanda has written extensively on indiaâ€™s freedom struggle, founded the nehru memorial museum and is considered the countryâ€™s foremost gandhian scholar. in this interview, he maintains that india still has much to learn from the father of the nation. how did gandhi handle the sort of communal mayhem that we are seeing in gujarat today? what did gandhi do in the face riots? he walked.when violence raged across eastern bengal and bihar in 1946, that old man walked from village to village, talking to people and trying to restore sanity. â€œmy appeal here,â€™â€™ he would say, â€œis not to the muslims as muslims nor to the hindus as hindus, but to ordinary human beings who have to keep their villages clean, build schools for their children and take many other steps, so that they can make life better.â€™â€™ also, do you remember what pandit nehru did in 1947? he would rush into the crowds and physically separate people, even hitting a few. these leaders were willing to stake their life for communal harmony. and, in fact, it was the shock of gandhiâ€™s death which finally quenched the flames of post-partition violence in the subcontinent. what strategies did gandhi adopt to further religious tolerance and harmony? for gandhi, these were not just issues to be discussed at times of disturbances, but goals to be pursued constantly. his own prayer meetings were never conducted in temples, mosques or churches, but under the sky. and they always included elements from different religions. or take his 1934 movement against untouchability during which he covered 12,000 milesâ€”meeting groups of villagers day after day, and explaining that there was no justification for denying a fellow human being access to roads, temples or wells. leaders like sardar patel sometimes complained that he was diverting attention from the national movement. but gandhi always replied, â€œyou cannot postpone every problem to after independence.â€™â€™ the orthodox elements often opposed him, but gandhi always invited them onto the dais to express their views. one man in particular was very abusive and, once when gandhi was absent, the villagers beat him up. gandhi went on a weekâ€™s fast as penance and told his followers, â€œthat man has every right to express his opinions.â€™â€™ this, to me, demonstrates his approach to dialogue and conflict resolution. is there anything we can learn from these strategies? the whole world today recognises the need for non-violent conflict resolution. there are 350 university departments and learned bodies around the globeâ€”not just in countries like the u.s. and the uk, but in places like latvia and finlandâ€”which are devoted to this subject. they study gandhi as the prophet of non-violence, the man who turned a personal ethic into a tool of social and political action. but, strangely, universities and academics in india tend to ignore him. why do you feel that indians have forgotten gandhi? let me ask you one simple question. gandhiâ€™s autobiography used to cost rs 2, now it costs rs 20. how many people do you know who own a copy? as far as most educated, english-speaking people are concerned, gandhi was a political leader, someone who brought freedom to the country and deserves reverence on october 2. they donâ€™t see how much his life and principles still apply. if gandhi were alive today, he would have said, â€œunderstand me, donâ€™t praise me.â€™â€™ but this is precisely what we have failed to do. why is gandhi so relevant today? i recently read a book by howard gardner which identifies the seven geniuses of the 20th century â€”einstein, t.s. eliot, freud, stravinsky, picasso, martha graham and gandhi. the author contends that geniuses are people who solve not only the problems of their own time, but also foresee future problems. all the major issues of todayâ€”from religious tolerance to ecological devastationâ€”were foreseen by gandhi at the beginning of the 20th century. and he had something relevant and practical to say about each of them. unlike marx, whose principles were framed in a library, gandhiâ€™s principles were framed in the context of life. take his attitude towards religion. before embarking on his journey through riot-torn noakhali in 1946, gandhi needed a secretary who could speak bengali and he requested n.k. bose, the eminent anthropologist. bose declined, saying, â€œi wonâ€™t be able to work for you because i donâ€™t believe in god.â€™â€™ to which gandhi replied, â€œyou believe in truth donâ€™t you? that is good enough for me.â€™â€™ what prompted you to begin your 50-year-long quest for gandhi? on january 30, 1948, i was a civil servant with the railways, and was posted at the border town of ferozepur. as a student in lahore, i had never been an uncritical admirer of gandhi, but when i heard the news that he had been shot dead, i found myself crying inconsolably. â€œhow did this man get into my bloodstream?â€™â€™ i wondered.the very next day, i went to the bookstore at ferozepur and bought every single book about gandhi and the freedom struggle. and that day began my search for gandhi.",0,0,1,0,0

816,962,"shabana azmi there is no denying that india has been a victim of terrorism, including cross-border terror propagated by pakistan for more than a decade now. hence, terrorism needs to be rooted out. but i am convinced the prevention of terrorism ordinance (poto), a draconian law, is impinging on our civil liberties and secular polity. like its predecessor tada, it will be misused. the conviction rate of tada arrests is a shocking 1.8 per cent. out of the 77,571 people arrested under tada, over 2000 were let off without trial because no evidence was found against them. surely, our fears that poto will be similarly misused should be addressed. instead we have home minister l k advani saying, â€˜â€˜those who oppose poto favour terrorism.â€™â€™ this shocking statement is like us president george bush announcing after september 11, in a cowboy style, â€˜â€˜either you are with us or with them (terrorists).â€™â€™ we are with neither. let this be clear. we oppose poto but that doesnâ€™t entitle anybody to cast a doubt on our patriotism or question our nationalism. it has been argued that poto is necessary to curb terror. how did the terror attack on parliament (december 13) happen, while poto was in existence? if poto had helped strengthen intelligence functioning, could the godhra carnage have happened? what then will poto be used for? the fear is, it will be used selectively against minorities. less than 48 hours after poto was passed in lok sabha, came reports that the ordinance has been selectively and widely used against muslims in gujarat, specifically those involved in the godhra incident. sixty people, all muslims, have been booked under poto. not one of the over 800 arrested for violence in ahmedabad and other areas of gujarat, have been booked under poto. it is obvious that for narendra modiâ€™s government, crimes by the minority community are considered more heinous than those committed by the majority and therefore more deserving of stringent punishment. for modi, the systematic targeting of families and putting entire neighbourhoods on fire is evidently not an act of terror. national security is of paramount importance. without protecting the security of a nation, individual rights cannot be protected. the worth of a nation is the worth of the individuals constituting it. â€˜â€˜the right to fair trial, the right of liberty and security of person, the right to freedom of expression, the right to redress and the right not to be tortured would all be at risk under poto,â€™â€™ is a fear expressed by amnesty international. law minister arun jaitley said, poto will clearly lay out for the police, the framework in which they can operate, thus they will not be able to misuse it. i disagree. similar repressive laws in the past have been used by the police to circumvent their usual course of probe. how do we deal with terrorism then? the nhrc says, â€˜â€˜a proper strengthening of the crime investigation and prosecution machinery and criminal justice system is needed. if there are a large number of acquittals today, it is not for the lack of laws, but for the lack of proper utilisation of these laws, lack of proper investigation and prosecution, and lack of adequate number of courts to try the offences. unless this root problem is readdressed, adopting draconian laws will only lead to their grave misuse.

gandhinagar: the bjp rulers of gujarat on friday adopted a belligerent mood, with two of its ministers resorting to unprecedented minority bashing in the wake of the second wave of communal violence that began in ahmedabad and other places of the state on march 15. senior cabinet minister fakirbhai vaghela, making an intervention in the state assembly, directly blamed the minorities for the recent disturbances in vatva, dani limda, kalupur, bapunagar, karanj, dariapur, shahpur, madhupura areas of ahmedabad. holding the portfolio of social justice and empowerment, vaghela said the minorities had attacked the dalits at all these places. he told the house to take a serious note of it. another minister, karsanbhai patel, in charge of the welfare of socially and educationally backward classes, keenly went deep into the reasons of the riots, saying their roots could be found in the ""anti-indian thinking"" of the muslims, despite the fact that ""nearly 95 per cent of them are converts from hinduism"". the sharply-worded remarks, curiously, stood in complete contrast to chief minister narendra modi''s appeal for restraint and tolerance on friday. appreciating the vishwa hindu parishad''s decision not to take out ''asthi yatra'' in the memory of the victims of godhra massacre, and that of tazia committees to avoid muharram procession, modi said in a statement here that these would go a long way in bringing about peace in the state. modi''s statement came soon after the congress spurned his proposal for a joint bjp-congress peace march to the income-tax circle in ahmedabad. instead, 40 congress mlas quietly walked out of the assembly in protest against the failure to handle the communal riots. soon after the walk-out at 8.45 am, following a short statement by congress deputy chief udesinh baria, the mlas sat on a dharna, singing ram dhun for three hours till 1 pm in front of the gandhi statue on the lawns of the assembly. patel said, ""mullahs, maulvis, congress and madrassas are responsible for anti-indian feelings among the muslims... who is responsible for their failure to be part of the national mainstream? i think, it is the congress'' sin of the last 50 years. it is not just the hindus'' misfortune but also that of the muslims of india."" approvingly referring to the march 17 bangalore rss resolution, he said, ""india''s muslims are not protected by police or military or political parties. they are protected by the inherent liberalism and non-communal nature of hindus."" patel added, ""the day the muslims lose the hindus'' goodwill, india''s police or military would not be able to save them. that is the reason why rss chief sudarshan said the muslims should try to obtain the goodwill of the hindus. to this, the congress reacted demanding ban on the rss. it is unfortunate that the muslims think that the bjp is its enemy. marxists, mullah-maulvis, those across the border, dawood ibrahim, bin laden, laskhar-e-toiba, jaish-i-mohammed are their enemies in the same way as the congress."" issues related with social justice to the minorities come directly under the departments headed by vaghela and patel. none of the two ministers, however, mentioned what had forced the muslims to leave their burnt houses and how the government proposes to solve their problems.",0,0,0,1,0

823,991,"hyderabad: in an interesting assessment of the unfolding political situation, the cpm has decided to revive the third front as a contender for power and at the same time agreed to cooperate with the congress without having any alliance with it. the three-yearly party congress, which is in session here to formulate its policy direction for the future, has called for building the peopleâ€™s front as a â€˜â€˜secular, democratic alternative to the ruling nda at the centreâ€™â€™. however, the party on thursday made it clear that despite the need for cooperation with the congress to meet the challenge of the â€˜â€˜communal agenda of the bjp and its allies in the sangh parivar, it would not favour an electoral alliance with the main opposition partyâ€™â€™. briefing reporters on the deliberations, party politburo member sitaram yechury termed the congress as a â€˜â€˜pale saffron partyâ€™â€™. asked to explain the â€˜â€˜dichotomyâ€™â€™ of the new cpm stand on broad opposition unity, he claimed that in the assessment of his party, the congress shared some of the follies of the bjp. the party in a resolution said: â€˜â€˜the continuous fight against religious fundamentalism was stressed upon in the discussion; sharpening of these struggles will pave the way to build a combination of non-bjp, non-congress forces that alone can help to meet the present critical situation.â€™â€™ yechury, however, said that in a situation where supporting the congress remained the only option for preventing the bjp from coming to power, his party would not hesitate to do that. he cited the instance of maharashtra where the left lent support to the congress-led coalition government. apart from defining its own role in national politics, the cpm session discussed at some length the threat of minority fundamentalism. the issue had triggered a massive controversy within the party after west bengal chief minister buddhadeb bhattacharjee recently expressed concern over such a menace. if the trend of deliberations was any indication, the party seemed to have veered round to the view that there was need to account for this danger. â€˜â€˜minority fundamentalism is not the correct response to majority fundamentalism,â€™â€™ yechury said, hinting at the mood in the session. in another significant departure, the party openly attacked the bjp allies in the nda instead of persuading them to reconsider their position. â€˜â€˜the most opportunistic political elements are the nda allies,â€™â€™ yechury said, pointing out that had they put real pressure on the vajpayee government for the army deployment on the first day of the gujarat riots, many lives would have been saved. the new party line seems to be an effort to put pressure on the nda partners to reconsider their future in the alliance and make the congress amenable to the left susceptibility to certain aspects of the economic reforms which it endorsed.

''at this moment when communal disturbances are taking place in parts of our country, it is important that we summon our traditional spirit of tolerance in order to establish peace and harmony among our people, he said in a message on the eve of holi. linking holi with communal harmony, narayanan observed that the festival of colours is symbolic of the multi-religious harmony that has existed in the country for centuries and the spirit of toleration that has been the essence of country's culture and civilisation. apart from not celebrating holi this year, narayanan declared he would also not receive any visitor on the day. if the earlier announcements by prime minister vajpayee and home minister l k advani that they would not celebrate holi had a somewhat hollow ring given their own political culpability for failing to rein in a partisan chief minister, the president's declaration is tantamount to a moral vote of no confidence in the two leaders. (congress president sonia gandhi also decided not to celebrate holi.) narayanan's message takes on special significance against the backdrop of warnings by citizens' groups in gujarat that sangh parivar activists are planning fresh attacks on the state's beleaguered muslim community. according reports lakhs of copies of an inflammatory and seditious pamphlet are being distributed in ahmedabad calling upon saffron extremists to indulge in more violence during holi. openly inciting attacks on muslims, the anonymous pamphlet says, ''police and army you also beware, you are also hindus...you should also support hindus.'' as on past occasions, president narayanan has not minced his words when it comes to taking a stand against violence. his message does seem to be in consonance with the mood of most citizens — who cannot understand how the riots and violence in gujarat have persisted for as long as a month. related stories

830,1017,"new delhi: senior congress leader ghulam nabi azad, who is the longest-serving member of the congress working committee (cwc), was summarily shifted to jammu and kashmir as the president of the pradesh congress committee (pcc) on wednesday. before being shifted, azad was aicc general secretary in-charge of up, kerala and tamil nadu. azadâ€™s abrupt removal, which sent alarm bells ringing in congress circles, is not likely to be an isolated case. this move is being seen as a precursor to a series of changes in the party organisation. the organisational revamp and key changes at the state-level have been in the offing for several months but were delayed because of congress president sonia gandhiâ€™s preoccupation first with the assembly polls and then the parliament session. key changes in the party are expected within the next few days. senior party leaders were at pains to explain that azad was not being sidelined and that he was being moved to j&k to strengthen the party in the state which is due to go to polls later this year. congress spokesperson s jaipal reddy was quick to state that â€˜â€˜azad is one of the most trusted and competent leadersâ€™â€™, adding that his shift to j&k was similar to pranab mukherjeeâ€™s move to west bengal on election-eve. however, others pointed out that azad has been one of the most high- profile congress leaders and has always been entrusted with important party positions at the centre, adding that this is the first time that he is being sent to a state. he replaces mohammed shafi qureshi who had earlier resigned as pcc chief. it is also no coincidence that azadâ€™s removal comes barely a month after the partyâ€™s dismal performance in the assembly elections in up where the aicc general secretary was in- charge. congress circles are rife with speculation over the organisational changes. former uppcc chief salman khurshid is being tipped to replace azad as party general secretary. khurshid, however, is also in the race for the uppcc presidentship once again as there is tremendous pressure for the removal of the present state party chief s p jaiswal following the partyâ€™s poor showing in the assembly poll. party insiders said aicc general secretaries mahavir prasad, mohsina kidwai and oscar fernandes are also likely to be entrusted with other responsibilities. prasad, it was stated, will be replaced by a dalit and among the names being mentioned are former governor mata prasad, pravin rashtrapal from gujarat, g venkatswamy from andhra pradesh and h hanumanthappa from karnataka.

gandhinagar: in the absence of the opposition congress on friday, which walked out en bloc from the state assembly to protest against suspension of their leader naresh raval, dissident bjp mlas jay narayan vyas, mahendra trivedi, arvind patel and atmaram parmar chose to embarrass senior ministers asking sharp questions on the neglect of the powerloom sector and state of the medical education in gujarat. participating in a question-hour debate, vyas fired the salvo by asking industries minister suresh mehta on what was being done to protect the state''s powerloom sector, facing stiff competition from the bhiwandi powerloom sector. he wanted to know whether or not the state government would provide fresh subsidies to the sector, currently suffering because of high electricity charges. surat mla atmaram patel wished to know what had happened to the committee formed to look into the problem. an embarrassed mehta replied that while the electricity tariff issue was something that the state government had no jurisdiction and a verdict on it was expected from the gujarat electricity regulatory commission (gerc), the issue whether to provide subsidy or not was under consideration. indicating that the proposed committee has not yet been formed, he said, ""this is also under consideration"". mehta informed the bjp mlas that the state had spent rs 195 crore as subsidy provided to the powerloom sector from august 2001 to october 2001. ""we had filed an affidavit with the gerc to bring down the electricity charges to the powerloom sector by 30 per cent. however, the gerc had refused to consider it. its judgment is awaited,"" he added. arvind patel wanted to know from state health minister ashok bhatt why non-gujaratis were preferred in 155 walk-in interviews for the post of medical tutors by signing bonds of rs 75,000. vyas commented, only ""outsiders were being encouraged"", while the gujaratis were made to fail in the interviews even if they had good marks. bhatt had to make frantic efforts to clarify that this was not so the case as quality matters. on the issue of having a postgraduate course in bhavnagar medical college, mahendra trivedi criticised bhatt for not giving exact time when it would start. bhatt merely said, ""we have fulfilled all the medical council of india (mci) conditions. we have asked the mci to send its inspectors to bhavnagar. we hope the classes will start soon.""",0,0,0,0,0

837,846,"new delhi: as expected, the governmentâ€™s move to enact a new stringent anti-terrorism legislation was defeated on thursday night when the rajya sabha rejected the prevention of terrorism ordinance bill by 113-98 vote, with 30 members absent from the 245-member house. the effective strength of the house at present is 241 with four seats vacant. the voting was on the same lines as in the lok sabha with the congress and left parties leading the fight against enactment of the bill and the ruling national democratic alliance staying firm. the nationalist congress party voted with the nda and the bahujan samaj party stayed away. after an evenly-matched decibel contest when the issue was put to voice vote after a marathon seven-hour debate, chairman krishan kant called for a poll division. first, the counter-resolution of the opposition, moved by kapil sibal of the congress, rejecting the governmentâ€™s move, was put to vote. it was passed by 113-98 votes. following this, the official resolution, for passage of the bill, moved by home minister advani, was voted on. it was rejected by same margin of 113-98 votes. the government now plans to convene a joint session of both houses of parliament early next week. this would be only the third such occasion in independent india. the earlier joint sessions were in 1961, on an anti-dowry law, and in 1978, on a banking recruitment law. the government has a small majority in the total strength of both houses. replying to the debate, advani said critics who said poto would neither solve nor prevent terrorism were missing the point. â€˜â€˜the prevention of corruption act doesnâ€™t mean corruption will end; the anti-murder laws donâ€™t stop murders. but you do need a weapon for the law-enforcing agencies to catch and convict terrorists and thus also put some apprehension in the lattersâ€™ mind on the likelihood of getting caught....poto can only be a small part of the overall fight to tackle this huge menace...much more needs changing in society.â€™â€™ his opponents said all this ignored indian reality. in a country, where the police routinely torture people in custody to extract confessions, making such confessions legally usable as evidence was idiotic. and in a country, where the police and state administration can connive in pogroms, as in gujarat, a draconian law in their hands is a potentially fatal attack on the democratic foundation. â€˜â€˜you already have a preventive detention law in the national security act. the nhrc, a statutory body chaired by a former chief justice, has firmly said existing laws are enough to tackle terrorism and the bill cannot be supported under any circumstances. why then are you pushing it, when there is such widespread opposition?â€™â€™ pleaded jurist fali nariman.

mumbai: with the holiday season fast approaching, more and more tourists are planning to spend their vacation in europe and the far east than in the us.

and it is not hard to guess why many of them are now thinking twice before booking a ticket to the us.

``the memory of the terrorist strikes in the us on september 11 is still fresh in their minds and they do not want to take the risk of visiting the u.s. this summer,'''' a travel agent explained.

an official of sotc, a mumbai-based travel agency, has estimated that travel to the u.s. could be down by 20 per cent this year because of the events on september 11. however, he was hopeful that the demand will pick up soon.

a spokesperson of the american consulate told tnn that in march 2001, 11,903 non-immigrant visas were issued. in february 2002 the figure was a mere 6,917. the figures for march 2002 are not available, but indications are that there can be a marginal increase.

traditionally, mumbaikars preferred the u.s. to other destinations because of its vast array of tourist attractions. but, the developments of september have diverted the summer holiday rush to places in europe and the far east.

an official of cox and kings, a well known travel firm, said, ``the demand has swung heavily this year for places in europe and the far east. hence we are offering a seven-day package tour to the far east for rs 32,500 with no hidden costs. the places covered include bangkok, pattaya beach and singapore. the cost includes air fare, sightseeing and hotel charges.''''

alternatively, by paying rs 99,000 a person can opt for a 15-day tour of europe and visit france, italy, switzerland, belgium, netherlands and the uk. as in the case of the far east, the amount includes cost of air fare, sightseeing charges and accommodation. ``many people have chosen the europe tour because it offers a lot of history,'''' he said.

spokesperson of travel corporation of india (tci) meher bhandara said the focus has shifted from the u.s. to south east asia this year.``at the moment there is not a big demand for the u.s. as it was the case earlier,'''' she stated.

for just $299 tci is offering a four-day tour of singapore or malaysia or thailand. ``we have even joined hands with malaysian tourism to promote that country which has a lot to offer. we are being flooded with inquiries about malaysia,'''' she stated. tci was also offering special packages to sri lanka.

``the demand for going on a holiday to australia, new zealand and the far east is more this year than it was in 2001,'''' a spokesperson for thomas cook stated. she said taking advantage of the popularity of these places her organisation has reached an understanding with hotels and airlines in australia to offer discounts. ``the discounts and the rates for the package tours are cheaper than last year,'''' she added.

according to her, the terrorist strikes in the us in september along with the economic recession has forced many people to cancel their holiday plans in december. ``now the situation has improved and the demand for holiday packages is rising,'''' she said.

with most of the city schools closing for the summer recess on april 18 there was is ``good response'''' for holiday packages offered by thomas cook.

the sotc official said the demand for travel to europe was 30 per cent more this year than in 2000. he said last year because of the quake in gujarat there was a sharp fall in the number of visitors going on a holiday abroad. this was because gujaratis constitute a sizeable chunk of holiday makers.

the package offered by sotc allows a couple to take a tour of europe by paying the cost for one person. in addition, there will be no charge for children below 12 years. for example, the earlier cost an individual had to bear for a 14-day european tour was 1,149 dollars. now, under the special incentive scheme two adults pay 1,699 dollars for the same tour. ``the demand for these packages is very good,'''' he added.",0,0,0,0,0
841,862,"new delhi: during the recent hearing on the issue of bhoomi puja, the supreme court had the occasion to learn from vhp counsel that â€˜â€˜there is no enmity between hindu and muslims. in fact, the electronic media and print media is responsible for creating oneâ€™â€™. counselâ€™s last ditch effort to persuade the court to allow the puja in the acquired land however failed. but, his submission must be welcomed to the extent that there is no enmity between the two communities. whether the latter part of the contention was a fair allegation against the media could be judged from the ground realities. that the court would have dismissed the counselâ€™s plea was obvious. the court had insisted on upholding the 1994 judgment, which categorically said the acquired land would be kept in the custody of the central government and not be used for any religious activity, temporary or permanent, by anyone. it maintained that a secular state cannot have any religion of its own. it cannot promote one religion at the cost of other. secularism being a basic feature of the constitution, the state or its instruments or officers are not expected to act in a manner which might leave an impression that the state is in favour of one community or religion. on this count, the acceptance of a â€˜â€˜shilaâ€™â€™ by shatrughan singh, in- charge of the ayodhya cell in the pmo, has reopened a debate on whether religion should be mixed with politics. the supreme court has time and again cautioned the political leadership against using derogatory expressions, including setting examples that may be construed as intemperate. â€˜â€˜lack of restraint in the language used and the derogatory terms made to refer to a group of people... indeed must be condemned... the likely impact of the language by a political leader is greater. it is, therefore, a greater need for the leaders to be more circumspect and careful in the language they use... this is essential not only for maintaining decency and propriety but also for the preservation of time-honoured values forming part of our cultural heritage,â€™â€™ a bench comprising justices j s verma, n p singh and k venkataswamy had said in a judgment.

hyderabad: scoffing at the speculation over a possible change in leadership of the party in the ongoing 17th national congress, the cpm has asserted that there was no such proposal and harkishan singh surjeet continued to be the general secretary of the party. â€œthere is no proposal for a change of leadership. we will not have candidates for the posts and we believe in collective leadership in the party represented by the politburo, central committee and general secretary. harkishan singh surjeet continues to be the party general secretary,â€� cpm politburo prakash karat said. participating in a meet-the-press programme organised by the andhra pradesh union of working journalists on thursday, karat said that he was puzzled as to why the issue of leadership has become a matter of speculation in the media. karatâ€™s statement assumes significance in the light of media speculation that the cpm was gearing up for a leadership change to infuse young blood into the party. reports in a section of media went to the extent of claiming that prakash karat had been selected as a successor to surjeet. â€œthe issue of change in leadership will not come up in the ongoing congress,â€� he categorically said. the senior cpm leader also rejected speculation that the party has decided to replace surjeet by him reiterating that surjeet continues to be the general secretary. taking exception to queries by reporters that the party was in the hands of gerontocrats, karat said that the party had a good combination of old and youth and over 60 per cent of its 8.4 lakh members across the country were below 40 years. strongly criticising the bjp-led central government for its attempts to enact the prevention of terrorism ordinance (poto), he said that the entire opposition was united in the issue and would not allow the passage of the bill which was put in the rajya sabha on thursday. the cpm leader alleged that the draconian provisions of poto were openly biased against the minority sections which was clearly reflected by its selective use by narendra modi government in gujarat. â€œthe gujarat government has used the provisions of the ordinance to target minorities and registered cases against 65 muslims for indulging in the godhra incident. however, not a single activist of the vishwa hindu parishad or bajrang dal which indulged in large-scale violence resulting in the killing of over 750 people in gujarat have been arrested so far,â€� karat said. karat pointed out that the provisions incorporated in poto were more dangerous than tada and any organisation could be declared terrorist under it without qualification of the charges. â€œthe members of such organisations including those who provide financial support to it at any point of time can be arrested under the clauses of preventive detention without a bail,â€� he said. karat appealed to the state governments of all non-bjp parties not to implement the act in their respective states even if the bill was passed by convening a joint session of parliament. â€œall the state governments should take a united stand on the issue. the west bengal and kerala governments have already clarified that they would not implement poto in their states,â€� he said adding this was one way to isolate the bjp.",0,0,1,1,0

ahmedabad: the d-day called march 15 has gone by and tension has ebbed in ayodhya. even ahmedabad remained largely calm on saturday. what, however, refused to decline was the flow of riot-victims seeking shelter at relief camps across the city. when amdavadis preferred to remain off roads in the walled city areas, riot victims continued to throng relief camps across in large numbers. people, who were stuck in different areas of the city waiting for the violence to die down, have begun re-emerging from their hideouts, making a beeline for the numerous relief camps dotting the city. with gory tales of mass murders on their lips and recounting days spent closetted inside dark dingy godowns, the riot victims continue to swell at camps like those at dariyakhan ghummat in sahibaug, aman chowk in bapunagar and shah-e-alam roza in shah alam area. the chairman of ahmedabad municipal corporation''s standing committee badruddin sheikh told tnn: ""the number of riot victims who have taken shelter in 24 camps across the city has now grown to 40,000. insecurity and fear of falling prey to stray incidents of violence coupled with partial ebb in the mayhem has driven many away from homes to safe havens like these relief camps."" the camp at sahibaug which is housed inside a modest campus of a municipal school near the dariyakhan ghummat saw an increase of 1,500 victims during the past 24 hours. afraid of a fresh outbreak of violence in riot-torn areas like dudheshwar, these people, most of whom are now homeless, have boosted the total number of riot-refugees at sahibaug to 6,000. ""the sahibaug area is in a curfew-like state on saturday. but even the fear and deserted roads could not keep these riot-affected away,"" said inamul iraki, a co-ordinator of the camp.

â€˜â€˜whenever there is communal trouble elsewhere we used to get a little scared. but we have faith in our neighbours.â€™â€™ adds mohd ayub, â€˜â€˜we know we have to live together so we should do it in the best way possible.â€™â€™ it shows. islamic prayers float past the mandir and the sound of bells can be heard in the masjid. the gloria church across the road reaching into the sky completes the picture of communal harmony. guwahati: hajo is a small town, 25 kms from guwahati. a scene of complete harmony for the last eight centuries. even the ayodhya demolition left it untouched. here a shrine was built in memory of hazrat shah sultan giasuddin aulia, the king of yemen who came here along with 70 disciples in 13th century. a stream of visitors visits this place, lighting candles or incense sticks before the shrine. syed mohtab ali, a teacher from a local school and bipul mahanta, an assistant librarian in a college, too are part of the congregation. haren sharma, one of the head priests of haygrib madhab mandir, one of the five temples in hajo, states muslims too visit the temple. and during the procession of gods at holi, people of both communities join in. srinagar: kashmir shaivism or muslim sufism â€” catch these here in kashmir where shrines of all denominations, muslim, hindu and sikh, are in close proximity with each other. the pilgrimage to shri amar nathji cave, situated at 14,000 feet in pahalgam took place about a 155 years ago when a muslim shepherd, adam malik, re-discovered the route to the holy cave. his progeny now reaps the rewards. jammu too has examples of hindu-muslim co-existence. the tomb of muslim saint peer roushan shah was not only made pucca but a beautiful mosque was attached to it by maharaja ranbir singh, a dogra ruler. thereâ€™s more. dargah, situated in the heart of jammu, a few metres from raghunath temple, is presently the dwelling place of hindus sadhus and muslim faqirs muzaffarpur: yeh mel-milap ka mahol hamesha se raha hai aur rahega (this atmosphere of goodwill has prevailed in the past and will continue in future),â€™â€™ says the imam of the companybag jama masjid, haji mohd ale hassan. he is confident that muzaffarpur will maintain its record of communal harmony. bangalore: the khwaja bande nawaz dargah and the temple of saint sharanabasaveshwara in gulbarga, in the northern tip of karnataka, are sterling examples of communal harmony through ages. the two saints â€” khwaja bande nawaz and sharanabasaveshwara â€”went beyond their respective religious borders and brought people together under one umbrella. the two religious seats in this historical town have lakhs of common devotees.

mumbai: both houses of the maharashtra legislature were adjourned for the day on saturday amidst noisy scenes on the issue of the state government''s move to discontinue the cotton monopoly procurement scheme in its present form.

in his budget speech on friday, finance minister jayant patil stated that the state-run scheme, which allows the monopolised purchase of cotton from farmers by the state authorities, was no longer feasible in view of the global competition. the minister also said that the government was in no mood to intervene in the commodities market any more.

the finance minister''s announcement sparked a wave of protests in the legislative assembly, with congress mla kirti gandhi raising the issue during question hour. leader of the opposition narayan rane and senior bjp leader gopinath munde were quick to back mr gandhi in demanding a categorical assurance from the government on the fate of the cotton monopoly procurement scheme.

867,881,"new delhi: the supreme courtâ€™s order vacating the ban on the implementation of the new national curriculum may have come as a reprieve for students and teachers. till friday they faced the prospects of having to sit in class without textbooks in the new academic session. but the plea on which the ncert got stay vacated - crores have been spent and 25 lakh textbooks have already been printed - does not seem true. sources in ncert refute this contention. according to them, the council is in a tizzy. till two days ago the manuscript of the ancient india textbook for class vi (to replace romilla thaparâ€™s book) hadnâ€™t been finalised. the council was still debating whether to introduce a section on ramayana and mahabharata and include pictures of the kumbh mela. according to a publisher involved with the new books, the ncertâ€™s claim that 25 lakh books are ready is highly exaggerated. as for history, eight copies of new textbooks were hurriedly bound together in case the court asked for it. fortunately it did not. says arjun dev, former ncert professor, â€˜â€˜the ncert seems to have played a fraud. considering that the new syllabus was approved only on january 21, 2002, 25 lakh books could not have been produced so fast, unless some private publishers were given access to the new syllabus, for a consideration, and they started printing, even before it was officially approved.â€™â€™ the ncert has to produce 95 new textbooks for various subjects. according to the affidavit submitted to the court by the ncert, 15 titles are ready, for another 15, the print order have been given, and for 18-20 more, the manuscripts are ready. that leaves 45 books under preparation. â€˜â€˜given the ncertâ€™s complete loss of credibility, one is not sure what these books are,â€™â€™ says prof dev.â€™â€™ says b g verghese, one of the petitioners of the pil (the other two are social activist and magasasay award winner aruna roy and sociologist meena tyabji), â€˜â€˜the courtâ€™s order is a victory for us, the stay on the substantiative part continues. the 25 lakh books, the ncert claims are ready, can remain in the warehouse till the matter is finally settled.â€™â€™ what if the court verdict goes against the ncert, wonâ€™t it be a colossal waste? â€˜â€˜why were the ncert and private publishers in such an indecent haste. they should suffer the consequences, he argues. what if the case drags on for years like ayodhya? â€˜â€˜it wonâ€™t, itâ€™s in nobodyâ€™s interest,â€™â€™ says verghese. adds prof dev, â€˜â€˜meanwhile, they can continue with the old books because technically the ban is on implementing the new curriculum, not on the existing one.â€™â€™ school principals are not too worried about having to do without textbooks for history, hindi, etc. as jyoti bose, principal, springdales, puts it: â€˜â€˜our teaching is not dependent on textbooks, they are at best an aid and guide. we will teach what we want to, doesnâ€™t matter which book they prescribe.â€™â€™ then what is all this fuss about?

mumbai: gujarat chief minister narendra modi''s statement that the gujarat riots were a reaction to the godhra incident is dangerous, said former prime minister v p singh on wednesday.

if the chain of action and reaction goes on, we will end up in a situationÂ� similar to bosnia, he warned, while answering questions at the pressÂ� club.

he warned that it would be dangerous to alienate the muslims. he said the proponents of hindu rashtra did not participate in the freedom struggle. but they were now teaching patriotism to others.

the former prime minister said that the riots in gujarat, apart from being inhuman, endangered the security of the country, since the army had to be called from the border.

corruption in defence deals should be treated as treason, he said. in reply to a question, he said that general pervez musharraf was taking steps to curb majority communalism in his country.

mumbai: the congress party caught the wrong end of the stick on wednesday when speaker after speaker at a youth congress-organised symposium on `politics of religion'' lambasted the party for exploiting religion for narrow political ends while professing to be secular.

to add to the organisers'' embarrassment, yc activists applauded the speakers'' critical remarks.

the bjp, by comparison, found little mention from the invitees, who included advocate yusuf muchhala of the all-india muslim personal law board, script writer javed akhtar, co-editor of communalism combat teesta setalvad, former chief secretary of maharashtra j.b. d''souza and ramji tewari, former head of the mumbai university''s hindi department. some of the speakers rubbed it in by saying that the topic ought to have been `religion of politics''.

ms setalvad set the tone by accusing the congress of being afraid to speak out against the narendra modi government for fear of losing the hindu vote.

reminding the audience that the congress was in power at the centre during the anti-sikh riots of 1984 and in maharashtra during the 1992-''93 riots in mumbai, muchhala said that he was struck by the similarity between those riots and the recent violence in gujarat. ``the partisanship of the police, the lack of political will, the explanation given by the ruling party are all too familiar,'''' he said.

akhtar blamed the congress for propping up fundamentalist muslim leaders while neglecting the moderates and said that the trend started right after independence.

ms setalvad, who has returned from a fact-finding trip to gujarat, said one of the leaders of the mob that attacked former congress mp ehsaan jaffrey''s house was a former congress corporator who had been denied a ticket by jaffrey.

she said the 65,000 people in the relief camps at ahmedabad were virtually starving and demanded to know what the congress was doing to organise aid for them. speakers also noted that no big business house had come forward to donate money towards relief work in gujarat.

muchhala lamented that democracy had come to be associated only with polls and the spirit of accommodation associated with it was missing. ``the congress could have utilised its organisational network in gujarat for relief work but it hasn''t,'''' he noted.

mumbai: the city remained peaceful on friday but the tensions over the ayodhya crisis were reflected in the poor attendance in schools and offices. however, there was no drop in air passenger traffic. no untoward incident was reported from any part of the state though deputy chief minister chhagan bhujbal revealed in the assembly that â€˜maha aartisâ€™ were performed at 70 places in the state. bandobust will continue in the city and the state for some more days. shops in bhendi bazar pydhonie, nagpada, j.j. marg and dongri areas were closed as muslims responded to their religious leadersâ€™ call of observing the day as â€˜yaume duaâ€™ (day of prayer). the vishwa hindu parishadâ€™s call to hindus for a ghantaa naad (mass ringing of temple bells) at 2 p.m. failed to evoke much response. according to the vhp, pujas were performed at hanuman mandir (tardeo), sanyas ashram (vile parle), radheshyam mandir (kalina), ambamata mandir (worli),ram mandir (govandi), ram mandir (borivali), ganesh mandir (matunga labour camp) and hanuman mandir (dadar). the vhp plans to intensify its agitation, with what it calls a â€˜jan andolanâ€™ for the ram temple at ayodhya. bjp mlas raj purohit and atul shah too participated in the vhpâ€™s programmes in south mumbai. mumbai police commissioner m.n. singh expressed his gratitude to various political and religious groups who extended their support in maintaining peace in mumbai. he was in constant touch with some of them till late on thursday night and on friday morning. â€œthe media has also played a significant role in spreading the message of peace,â€™â€™ he stated. â€œwe have been preparing for the friday bandobast since last week. it involved a great deal of planning, reviewing security and interacting with the public,â€™â€™ mr singh said. â€œas i have been saying, it is always a sustained hate campaign that leads to riots. if the atmosphere gets surcharged, a little spark causes a conflagration.â€™â€™ the commissioner said that the city had learnt its lessons from 1992-â€™93 riots. â€œsince then, the police along with the mohalla committees have been building up an atmosphere of peace and keeping hate campaigns under check. according to mr singh, the police had detained nearly 1,000 persons on friday including those with criminal records and bad character. â€œi was only worried that some mischief monger would create trouble,â€™â€™ he said. state director general of police, subhash malhotra thanked leaders of both the communities for ensuring peace. â€œi am really grateful to all the religious leaders who showed tremendous strength and maturity throughout last fortnight,â€™â€™ he told tnn. he said the police had been working hard since february 26 and all unit commanders at the commissionerate and district headquarters ensured that no ugly incident happened during this period. â€œour peace committees in the districts also ensured that each community retained confidence in the other,â€™â€™ he said. mr malhotra said the police would continue to be on a high alert. â€œwe would take a review of the situation in a few days and accordingly security measures will be redrafted,â€™â€™ he said.",0,1,1,0,0

lucknow: crowned with glistening snow, eternal abode of lord shiva, source of the mighty ganga and covered in a thick haze of myth, the himalayas have cast a magic spell on swami sunderanand. and, unlike those hell bent on making the ayodhya tangle knottier, he is a sadhu with a difference (or a real one!). swami sunderanand has been on a constant spiritual flight, capturing the natureâ€™s beauty in its vivid forms. and his five decades of labour has taken form of a fabulously printed 375-page book though the lens of a sadhu, which is a rare collection of his 425 out of over 50,000 photographs taken by him. although the book had already been released by prime minister atal behari vajpayee in new delhi recently, it was dedicated to people by governor vishnukant shastri here at raj bhawan on saturday. ""i am simply amazed by the works of the swami,"" the governor paid his tribute to him. for nearly 54 years, the swami has been living in gangotri in uttarkashi district of uttaranchal, observing the himalayan range in its different moods â€” sometimes benevolent, like vishnu; sometime fearsome, like shiva in the midst of tandava ready to devastate; sometimes bewitching, giving a â€˜come hitherâ€™ look, like one of those fairy tale apsaras. over the years, swami sunderanand has become a part and parcel of the great mountains and their mystique. in a fixed state of trance, he looks through the viewfinder and there are the shining peaks, the shadowy valleys, the rippling waterfalls flowing into eternity, washing away the sins of many, giving spiritual sustenance to millions far away in the plains of india. his collection of pictures are indeed an endless source of pleasure and have featured in the worldâ€™s best magazines and journals. so, here you have the himalayas in the ever changing light â€” the first streak of dawn touching and lighting up the higher peaks or the sunset spraying a glow of warm colour on their summits; the mountains standing forth in their massive glory in the shimmering sunlight and then a bright moon illuminating their soft and shadowy grandeur. the book in true sense makes it possible for those who have never witnessed the grandeur of mountains to have the feel of glacier with the massive and gorgeous mountain and the physical perfection of gangotri itself with its towering peak. now at 75, the swami has never stopped right since his japanese disciples presented him a camera in the early 60s. he continues to pursue his obsession even when the temperature is below freezing point. for his contribution, a glacier of the garhwal himalayas has been named after him. for his spiritual attainment, he has travelled the length and the breadth of the garhwal himalayas and scaled a height of even 23000 ft for capturing it in its varied moods. recalling his experience, he says, it is a divine pleasure to be so near to these sublime mountains where the foot of man had never trod. they remind us of their proud and isolated position for countless ages and promise to remain there in their imperishable beauty for hundreds of years to follow, provided man does not fiddle with them. but he laments that devastation of forests and ill-conceived plan for natureâ€™s conservation is a cause of worry.",0,0,0,0,0

ayodhya: the vishwa hindu parishad (vhp) executive will meet at karsevakpuram here on wednesday and thursday to chalk out strategy for the temple construction. the parishad is likely to defer the deadline set for the ram temple construction at the acquired complex. the meeting, which will be presided over by ailing ashok singhal, assumes significance in the backdrop of the recent vhpâ€™s decision to reconsider its plan for the present phase of the temple movement. the parishad leaders on sunday decided to reconsider their resolve to start the temple construction work by june 2, 2002, the last day of the ongoing purna ahuti yagya, as well as the deadline set by them for handing over the undisputed 42 acre part of the acquired area in ayodhya to ram janmabhoomi nyas. â€œin the changed circumstances, the vhp has decided to reconsider its resolve to start the temple construction by the end of purna ahuti yagya as things have started moving in positive directionâ€�, said vhp senior vice-president acharya giriraj kishore while talking to times news network here on tuesday. he said that â€œram temple is on the top of the vhpâ€™s agenda. we will definitely construct the temple keeping in mind the law of the land. the government should do its work and we will do ours. for us, it is a matter of faith, not politics.â€� singhal, who broke his indefinite fast on monday night following assurance given by the ministry of home affairs to restore train services to ayodhya from tuesday morning, cancelled all his appointment fixed for tuesday on his physiciansâ€™ advice. the vhp leaderâ€™s condition sharply deteriorated owing to his refusal to take the life saving drugs. meanwhile, hundreds of pilgrims from far-flung areas visited ayodhya on tuesday following the restoration of train services. they took a dip in the saryu and offered prayers to lord rama. marudhar express was the first train to arrive here early on tuesday morning.

ahmedabad: nearly four weeks after the godhra carnage and some 700 deaths later, the gujarat pradesh congress got over party politicking and appointed a panel of senior lawyers to help refugees and victims in riot-camps lodge complaints with the police in various parts of the state. the move is subsequent to a letter written by leader of the opposition in the lok sabha and congress president sonia gandhi to prime minister ab vajpayee after her visit to riot-torn gujarat earlier this month, urging the centre to take steps to restore peace in the state and sensitise the police force to enable them to handle their duties with understanding and impartiality. in this letter of march 16, a copy of which was made available to the tnn, sonia described as ""far from satisfactory"", the action taken by the gujarat government towards rebuilding and rehabilitation. ""we hope that at least in this task there will be no discrimination and relief will be provided in a non-partisan manner"", she stated. annexed with the letter is a detailed note on the situation in gujarat which lists out the demands on relief and rehabilitation. vajpayee is learnt to have taken cognisance of the letter and stated in his reply on saturday in another letter, that, ""i have directed the gujarat government to form an all-party committee chaired by the governor which would ensure the implementation and planning of the rehabilitation work."" he also ensured that there would be no place for discrimination of any kind or partisan attitudes in the whole exercise. the annexure in sonia''s letter, which is prepared by the party consequent to the tour of riot-hit gujarat, notes that ""the police seems to be under instructions to register complaints against mobs and not against those leading them or those involved in killings, burnings, looting etc."". it alleges that despite the fact that the victims knew the rioters by name and are willing to disclose it, the police were unwilling to register cases against them. further, the congress has demanded that all those riot-affected people who do not want to go back to their villages and have lost everything should be enlisted as ""below poverty line families and be provided government assistance to resume economic activities"". apart from the demand to rebuild religious places of the minorities which were destroyed during the riots, the congress president suggested that those commercial premises rented out to minorities which were destroyed in the riots should be restored to the original tenants. this followed reports that the original owners had taken possession of such properties. on sunday, the congress convened an emergency meeting at the mayoral bungalow and took stock of the situation prevailing in the state. it was here that the panel of high court lawyers was formed. the panel comprises maganlal barot (vadodara), krishnakant vakhariya (dahod and panchmahals), yatin oza and tushar mehta (sabarkantha, kheda, anand), harin raval and iqbal shaikh (mehsana), shaktisinh gohil (bhavnagar), nirupam nanavati (rajkot) and gaurav pandya (surat city).",0,0,1,1,0

ahmedabad: violence showed no signs of abating in gujarat three weeks after the communal riots broke out. while two persons were killed in police firing in ahmedabad''s vatva area on wednesday, another victim of police firing in modasa succumbed to injuries at vs hospital here. tension gripped modasa, under indefinite curfew since tuesday, as the body of the police fire victim was handed over to his family. curfew was clamped on himmatnagar in sabarkantha after the recovery of the body of a boy, who was missing since tuesday, sparked arson and rioting. hsc (class xii) board exams were also cancelled. ahmedabad continued to seethe with two persons, including a woman, being killed in police firing after mobs went on the rampage in vatva, torching hutments and cabins with petrol bombs before the police moved in and restored order. the mob set ablaze a godown and hutments in the nava chunaravaas area around 5 pm. sources told tnn, ""when the police tried to restrain them, they pelted stones and threw petrol bombs."" tear-gas shells were lobbed after which the police opened fire. five people, including two women, were injured and hospitalised. official sources in himmatnagar said tension built up in the city after the body of the missing boy was found. he had come to the city for shopping from vadali on tuesday when he went missing. though his motorbike was found parked near a store, there was no trace of him and an offence was lodged. but a mob surrounded the police station and set ablaze some seven huts in the chhaparia to vent their anger. tear-gas shells were lobbed to disperse the crowd. sabarkantha district collector mukesh puri said the situation was under control since 4 pm when curfew was imposed.

910,968,"hyderabad: lending a new element to the current political turmoil, the cpm has called some of the nda constituents to leave the ruling coalition and hinted at the possibility of accommodating them in the people's front. as part of its effort to build the third alternative, the ongoing party session here has assessed that the ''transgression'' of the nda agenda by the vajpayee government on the ayodhya issue had provided the partners with the cause for reviewing their continuation in the coalition. this, in fact, was the most significant outcome of the marathon debate at the party congress on the draft political resolution. during the two-day discussion, there were awkward moments for the top leadership when some of the state units questioned its growing proximity to the congress in national politics. the kerala unit, in particular, lost no opportunity in pointing out that the party's confrontation with the congress had left a bitter and bloody trail. in tripura, one participant recalled, the congress had been accused of seeking support from insurgent elements to defeat the cpm. scurrying under attack from the state units, the leadership hurriedly announced projecting the third alternative leaving the congress out of its ambit. in an effort to invest the third front idea with a greater sense of urgency, the party on friday said that adjusting some of the nda constituents into the new grouping was a distinct possibility. ''the partners should rethink their position in the coalition in view of the violation of the nda agenda by the government with its connivance with the vhp on the ayodhya issue,'' cpm politburo member prakash karat told reporters. replying to a question, karat agreed that if some of the bjp allies decided to leave the nda, their admission into the people's front could be considered. ''how can we say no if they leave the bjp?'' he remarked. he claimed that the centre's conduct during the recent ayodhya episode was enough reason for the nda partners to come out of the alliance. ''the attorney-general's unprecedented argument in court to allow puja on the disputed land, the dispatch of a pmo official to receive the shila from the sadhus — all this was clear evidence of the bjp-led government patronising the vhp movement,'' he said. significantly, west bengal chief minister buddhadeb bhattacharjee is slated to meet his andhra pradesh counterpart chandrababu naidu on saturday. observers see the meeting as the beginning of the left's renewed effort to wean away the ''secular'' parties from the bjp.

kolkata: syed shahabuddin, former mp and president of the all india muslim majlis-e-mushawarat, demanded reservation for muslims in west bengal on tuesday. he was speaking at a press conference organised by the state chapter of the mushawarat at the office of the kerala muslim association in kolkata. â€œmuslims of west bengal are the most backward in the country. even the muslims in assam and bihar are better off,â€� he said. â€œin west bengal, where muslims comprise 23 per cent of the population, they have barely two to three per cent representation in government jobs, hardly any in the university or industry. it is a shame for a state being ruled by a left government for the last 25 years,â€� he observed. urging that the government declare the community backward and introduce reservation in â€œpublic employment, welfare programmes, post-matric higher education and credit flow from public banksâ€�, shahabuddin demanded, â€œgive us our share and not more than that.â€� the former mp also criticised the state government on the madrasah issue. â€œif a particular madrasah or mosque or persons associated with these institutions are found to be involved in anti-national activities, treat them as individuals. donâ€™t give the whole community a bad name,â€� he said. he reiterated that every community had the right to have its own educational institutions. â€œany survey of west bengal reveals that muslims here are educationally backward. there are not enough schools in muslim mahallahs.â€� he urged the government to set up schools in keeping with the national norms. â€œdo it for all, but specially for muslims.â€� he complained that â€œwhatever little the community does for itself, the left government discourages even thatâ€�. shahabuddin also condemned the attack on a church in islamabad. he demanded that the gujarat chief minister, â€œwho is nothing but a sangh pracharak and has no administrative experienceâ€�, must go.",0,0,0,0,0

ahmedabad: former chief minister madhavsinh solanki recalls a debate in parliament in the late 1970s when morarji desai was the prime minister and he was being castigated by the then congress mp vasant sathe on the riots in mumbai that had killed over 100 people. solanki, an mp from gujarat at that time, says desai explained that while the human toll was quite high, all the violence had taken place in just one-and-a-half hours after which peace was restored. ""when modi says he controlled everything in 72 hours, he is not realising that this is too long a period to restore order,"" he says. ""time is a big factor in controlling such situations,"" says the former chief minister. but over three weeks or over 500 hours now after modi made that famous remark, just take a look around gujarat and one will find signs of the ''control'' he is talking about. the toll in the violence is now close to the 800 mark and killings have become a day-to-day affair in the state with virtually no signs of a let-up. the icing on the cake is, of course, modi''s statement in rajkot on saturday where he blamed the statements made by ''non-secular'' parties in delhi which, he says, are stoking the violence in gujarat. neither the chief minister nor any member of his council of ministers has provided a reassuring face to the strife-torn society of gujarat. in fact, even bjp ministers, who have been elected from constituencies in ahmedabad, are afraid of venturing out into the muslim-dominated areas or at least pay a visit to the various relief camps which - as the violence enters the fourth week - still house thousands of refugees. instead, in the state assembly on friday, a senior minister of the modi cabinet, fakir vaghela, unabashedly blamed the muslims for attacking the dalits during the riots. while another minister, karsan patel, recalled the rss resolution in bangalore recently where it was stated that the muslims could feel secure only with the goodwill of the hindus. violence has now entered the fourth week and since march 15, when the ram shila daan took place in ayodhya, some 25 people have been killed in gujarat. modi knows timing is of paramount importance. even when he took over as chief minister in october 2001, he had made it clear that he was here to play a one-day international and not a five-day test match. it is indeed baffling then that the chief minister has allowed things to drift in the last couple of weeks when he should have been putting into place an effective law and order machinery by replacing some of the officials who have sullied the name of the entire police force. instead, if anybody has been targeted, it is a handful of police officers who thought their call of duty was more important than the signals from the political leadership. the continuing bouts of violence in ahmedabad and vadodara and some of the smaller towns show a complete break-down in the law and order machinery and loss of faith in the administration. countless number of muslims, many of them in government and corporate jobs, are planning to leave the borders of the state at the first given opportunity. if the government had hoped that ''riot fatigue'' would set in, then it hasn''t. there are fears that there is a deliberate attempt to keep the burning embers of communalism alive for political gains. even the national human rights commission chairman, justice j s verma, was forced to think out aloud why normalcy had not been restored so far.",0,0,1,0,0
920,1020,"new delhi: the next of kin of gujarat riot victims will be paid sum of rs 1 lakh each and the state government will bear 50 per cent of these costs, chief minister narendra modi has said. an estimated 700 people have been killed during these riots. modi, who was summoned to delhi by prime minister atal behari vajpayee on wednesday morning, said the state government has requested the centre to send in more relief to the riot victims and to re-construct the damaged buildings. the gujarat chief minister clarified that no relief camps is gujarat will be closed down; there are 101 relief camps all over gujarat and an estimated 97,000 people are currently living in those camps. ""the camps will continue to exist until the people residing there feel confident of coming out and going back to their homes,"" modi said. this was the first time since the godhra incidents in late february 2002 that modi was meeting the prime minister. the meeting happened at a time when modi was facing wide-spread criticism over his failure to prevent rioting in his state. his government has also been accused of being in complicity with the rioters. the riots and the opposition''s distrust in the modi government notwithstanding, the bjp-led government has little options to replace modi as he is currently the only bjp chief minister representing a major state. as if to prove modi''s detractors wrong, the police also, at last, seems to be taking some action to stop the rioters. one person was killed and six others injured in the eastern part of ahmedabad on tuesday night when the police fired to disperse mobs pelting stones. modi, who came to the capital on wednesday morning, was closeted in a meeting with the prime minister and home minister l k advani. minister of state in the prime minister''s office, vijay goel and senior government officials also participated in the meeting. the gujarat chief minister, it was learnt, made a detailed powerpoint presentation on how peace was spreading fast in gujarat. among the examples that modi had provided were: the muslim festival of muharram went off peacefully in the state, there has been no untoward incidents in the ongoing panchayati election campaigning in the state, the board exams have gone off well and the 3,500 hajis who had visited mecca from gujarat have all come back safely. modi, it was learnt, has also extended an invitation to the prime minister to visit the state and personally witness the peace process. reacting to media reports on the gujarat government shunting out a few ""honest"" police officers because they had dared to go against the ruling party diktat and arrested hoodlums with vhp links, modi said, ""much is being made out of these transfers. all of them are promotion postings"". he, however, declined to comment on the reports of the national human rights commission. all he said was that the state government was committed in sending its report to the nhrc by march 27 and the report would reach the commission by wednesday evening. related stories:Â 1 killed in ahmedabad, police firing in vadodaraÂ fear still stalks gujaratÂ full coverage: gujarat violence

921,1022,"ahmedabad: a public interest litigation was filed in the gujarat high court on wednesday challenging the jurisdiction of the national human rights commission (nhrc), under section 36 of the protection of human rights commission act, to intervene in violence-torn gujarat. a division bench comprising justice d s sinha, chief justice of high court, and justice b c patel issued notices in the petition filed by the city-based karuna public charitable trust, making them returnable on april 8 next. the notices have been issued to nhrc, its chairman justice j s verma, union of india and gujarat government. the pil sought direction that the nhrc or its chairman may not be allowed to investigate or intervene in the circumstances that led to widespread violence in gujarat specially as they were no more under nhrc''s jurisdiction after the appointment of the k g shah commission by the state government to probe godhra train carnage and the subsequent reprisal attacks under the commission of inquiry act. the petition also sought direction for deletion and removal from the nhrc''s records facts, statements, evidences, affidavits, depositions, photographs, documents and materials. s b vakil, counsel for the petitioner, submitted that the pil was filed for restraining the nhrc from making any report on the basis of reports of facts, statements and evidences in any manner collected under the provisions of the protection of human rights commission act, 1993 as the express provisions of section 36 (1) provides that the commission shall not inquire into any matter which was pending before a state commission or any other commission duly constituted under any law. the nhrc cannot take cognizance in the present case as the gujarat government has already appointed a one-man commission under retired high court judge justice k g shah under the provisions of commission of inquiry act, he added. vakil submitted that it was improper for justice verma to criticise state government even before taking up the matter. the nhrc chairman was well within his right to visit any place in gujarat and take whatever steps he deemed proper under the act in fulfilling his constitutional obligations, vakil said. ""but before proceeding in the matter, if the nhrc pronounces that the state government has failed to discharge its duty in protecting the safety of its people, then it was being unfair,"" he added.

hyderabad: in an interesting assessment of the unfolding political situation, the cpm has decided to revive the third front as a contender for power and at the same time agreed to cooperate with the congress without having any alliance with it. the three-yearly party congress, which is in session here to formulate its policy direction for the future, has called for building the peoples front as a â€œsecular, democratic alternative to the ruling nda at the centre. however, the party on thursday made it clear that despite the need for cooperation with the congress to meet the challenge of the â€œcommunal agenda of the bharatiya janata party and its allies in the sangh parivar, it would not favour an electoral alliance with the main opposition partyâ€�. briefing reporters on the deliberations, party politburo member sitaram yechuri termed the congress as a â€œpale saffron party. asked to explain the â€œdichotomy of the new cpm stand on a broad opposition unity, he claimed that in the assessment of his party the congress shared some of the follies of the bjp. the party in a resolution said, â€œthe continuous fight against religious fundamentalism are stressed upon in the discussion; sharpening of these struggles will pave the way to build a combination of non-bjp, non-congress forces that alone can help to meet the present critical situation.â€� yechuri, however, said that in a situation where supporting the congress remained the only option for preventing the bjp, his party would not hesitate to do that. he cited the instance of maharashtra where the left lent support to the congress-led coalition government. apart from defining its own role in national politics, the cpm session discussed at some length the threat of minority fundamentalism. the issue had triggered a massive controversy within the party after west bengal chief minister buddhadeb bhattacharjee recently expressed concern over such a menace. if the trend of deliberations was any indication the party seemed to have veered round to the view that there was a need to account for this danger. â€œminority fundamentalism is not the correct response to majority fundamentalism, yechuri said hinting at the mood in the session. in another significant departure, the party openly attacked the bjp allies in the nda instead of persuading them to reconsider their position. â€œthe most opportunistic political elements are the nda allies, yechuri said pointing out that had they put real pressure on the vajpayee government for army deployment on the first day of the gujarat riots, many lives would have been saved. the new party line seems to be an effort to pressurise the nda partners to reconsider their future in the alliance and make the congress amenable to the left susceptibility to certain aspects of the economic reforms which it endorsed.",0,0,0,0,0

bangalore: the political scene in karnataka resembles a cyclone-ravaged township, after the elections to four rajya sabha seats. flamboyant liquor baron vijay mallya stormed the field like a tornado, shook the edifice of the ruling congress, wreaked havoc in the bjp camp, left the janata dal shell-shocked and then moved to parliament house in delhi. while the congress and bjp are now pondering over what went wrong, janata dal is wondering what went right. let us look into the arithmetic of mallya''s victory: â€¢ mallya entered the fray as an independent. he had just 31 votes in his kitty __ janata dal parivar 23 (jd-u 19; jd-s 4), independents 6 and expelled bjp members 2. he needed 14 more. he had to fend for himself to get the extra votes. but he managed to get 15 more, that too first preference votes, upsetting all calculations. he secured 46. â€¢ mallya''s rival, bjp''s taradevi, who was short of just five votes (her party''s strength is 40), bit the dust as she could secure only 34. six of her own party legislators did not vote for her. neither did she receive any second preference votes. did the six partymen vote for mallya? the party says yes, while the legislators say no. â€¢ the congress, on advice from its high command, asked its 147 mlas, including four associate members, to cast second preference votes in mallya''s favour. it allocated 49 first preference votes each for its candidates janardhana poojary, prema cariappa and rajashekaran. the surplus four votes to each of them was allotted as a precaution. to the party''s surprise, poojary polled 50 votes (one more than the allotted quota), cariappa 45 (four less) and rajashekaran 44 (five less). how did the two candidates fail to get the full quota of votes? did the nine first preference votes go to mallya? it appears so. â€¢ result: mallya did not have to wait for the second preference votes to be counted. he secured 46 first preference votes __ more than that polled by two congress candidates. the big question here is: did six from the bjp and nine from the congress cross-vote for mallya? partymen are looking at each other with suspicion in both the camps. the bjp is the worst hit. its morale is already low, what with the national unit under flak over the gujarat massacre and ayodhya imbroglio, and the humiliating defeat in the recently-held elections __ the latest being the delhi civic poll. to add insult to injury, the state bjp is plagued with infighting, dissidence, groupism and personal animosities. that a bjp candidate could not secure the votes of members of her own party, considered at one time to have the most disciplined cadres, speaks volumes of the mess. the bjp has expelled the six, who it suspects of having cross-voted for mallya. more are said to be in the line of fire. at this rate, it is certain to lose the status of principal opposition in the state assembly. instead of looking within, fixing fences and putting the house in order, the leadership is pointing an accusing finger at the congress. it is high time the national leadership intervenes and drives some sense into the heads of warring members. whatever happened to the party''s dream of forming a government in karnataka, its first in the south? going by the happenings in the party, it looks the dream will remain a dream, at least in the near future. the congress too has reasons to worry. one, two of its candidates received less than the quota of first preference votes allotted. two, the said votes appear to have gone to mallya. it means open defiance of the party whip. the party cannot ignore the development. yes, in the past too, members have voted for individuals against the party''s wishes. this time it was too blatant. had not the party allotted surplus votes to its three candidates, one or the other would have even suffered defeat, causing acute embarrassment. the congress may be relishing with glee the mess in bjp, but it cannot lose sight of the fact that the janata dal parivar is regrouping. it won the kanakapura byelection against all odds and sent former pm deve gowda to parliament. the victory applied the brakes on the congress juggernaut. now, on ramakrishna hegde''s advice, the dal lent support to mallya, who in turn sent a scare in the congress camp and unsettled the bjp. some senior congressmen wonder why the party didn''t ask the high-profile mallya to contest as its candidate, than allow the dal to bask in his glory. after all he is a well-known face, a close relative of chief minister krishna, and an established industrialist who has his heart in karnataka. be it the congress or bjp, introspection is the need of the hour. the bjp must put its house in order if it is keen to prove it is still a force to reckon with in the state. the congress leadership must take a serious view of the cross-voting by some of its mlas. if it prefers to turn a blind eye to that, dissidence is bound to raise its ugly head sooner or later. dissidence was the main cause of congress''s defeat in the 1994 assembly elections. hopefully congressmen remember that. in the janata dal camp, there is excitement. mallya''s victory has given the parivar another shot in the arm, the first one being from kanakapura. but both the gowda and hegde factions are bewildered how mallya made it to the post. balram.singh@timesgroup.com or balramhs@indiatimes.com.

""central government's acts of omission and commission on ayodhya are shameful to say the least,"" she said. turning to gujarat, she blasted the narendra modi government over the handling of recent violence in the state saying the ""complicity"" of the government in the incidents stood thoroughly exposed. she hit out at union home minister l k advani for giving a ""clean chit"" to the state government and the chief minister. asserting that the continuance of ""irresponsible and callous"" government in gujarat was an affront to the country's secular polity, she demanded that the judicial probe into the violence be conducted by a sitting judge of the supreme court. on the issue of national security, gandhi said there was ""no no evidence"" of a clear-cut strategy on the part of the government on jammu and kashmir and that people in the state continued to suffer while security forces faced grave risk. she regretted that even after two years of its submission, the house had been kept in the dark on the report of the subrahmanyan committee on kargil conflict and its implementation. the congress leader wanted to know from the government the progress on the list of 20 terrorists and criminals wanted from pakistan, whether islamabad's approach to cross-border terrorism has changed and the response of the international community to the speech of president pervez musharraf on january 12. she lashed out at the prime minister for re-inducting george fernandes as defence minister when the venkataswami commission was continuing with its probe into the tehelka expose. ""the prime minister has given fernandes a clean chit but what message has gone to the judge (probing the expose),"" gandhi said, adding the central vigilance commission reports on corruption had been ""hushed up"" and journalists exposing corruption in high places being targeted. in an obvious reference to the import of coffins for armed forces martyrs, she charged a senior minister with criticising the comptroller and auditor general for pulling up the defence ministry and said he had defiled the authority of the public accounts committee. gandhi referred to the ""carnage"" in godhra and the subsequent ""genocide"" in several parts of gujarat. observing that the gujarat episode was the ""symptom of the deeper malaise afflicting the country-that of politics of hate"", she said there were some representing this in the treasury benches. ""some are charge-sheeted"". gandhi stressed that the guilty must not be spared and all must ensure that peace returns to gujarat. attacking the budget, the congress leader said it was a ""mockery of sentiments"" expressed in the president's speech and that economic policies would lead to slowdown of growth. the employment scenario has never been as grave, she said ridiculing government's plans to provide ten million jobs per year. ""the government's policies have struck fear in the hearts of the working class,"" she said terming as ""misplaced priority"" the moves to retrench people from state-owned companies. attacking the government for its privatisation policy, gandhi asked why profit-making public sector undertakings were being sold off. criticising the hike in prices of kerosene and cooking gas, she said farmers were now facing mounting debts thanks to the increase in prices of urea and other fertilisers. gandhi sought immediate convening of a meeting of the central advisory board before changes in textbooks were approved.

""no matter what the prime minister or the law board members say, i strongly feel it is only the supreme court which can be trusted and which can solve the issue."" in light of the recent turn of events, there is an urgent need to speed up the case proceedings, the imam said. ""a day-to-day hearing is required and a solution must be found at the earliest so that there is no further damage to peace,"" he added. when asked about friday's shila daan at ayodhya, bukhari said it did not matter as long as it was not done on the land banned under the court's order. ""if it happens elsewhere, it is essentially a question of how the state looks at it. the real question here is that if a government officer is accepting a shila, it amounts to a government establishment tacitly accepting the vhp position. that shila is ultimately meant to be used in the ram temple which they want to construct there and the map of the temple includes both the disputed and undisputed land,"" bukhari said. ""they (the vhp) should learn to obey the rule of law of the land as much as anybody else. we have seen that even a written undertaking by them to the court means nothing to them. hence, there is a need for the government to be stern with them.""

ahmedabad: when union home minister l k advani answered rajya sabha mp shabana azmiâ€™s query in the parliament on monday saying that more from the majority community fell to police bullets than the minorities in the recent riots, he was referring to the whole of gujarat. sixty per cent of the people who died due to police firing were from the majority community, the state-wide figures show. but the scene in ahmedabad is quite the reverse. in the city that is considered communally and politically most volatile, more members of the minority community died in the police firing. according to figures available, 57 per cent (23 out of 40) of the people killed in the police firing belong to the minority community. this figure should be seen with the toll of rioting in ahmedabad which shows that out of the 286 people killed, some 41 were hindus killed in about 5,500 rounds of firing by the police. similarly in the state, of the 571 people who died in other violence, 494 people from the minority community were killed in the riots that followed the godhra carnage as compared to 77 from the majority community. but the state figures, as against ahmedabad, show that of the 100 that succumbed to the police firing, 60 were hindus. â€˜â€˜if the minorities were the victims of riots as they were and at the same time more of them die in the police firing, then the most charitable that one can get is to say is that police firing was not well directed,â€™â€™ said a retired senior police officer. â€˜â€˜on the other hand you could say that the local police have also fallen victim to the communal forces. some allegations that a very senior police officer stood and watched as mobs ran riot at the naroda and meghaninagar areas would only give credence to such a line of reasoning,â€™â€™ he added.",1,0,1,1,1

938,866,"new delhi: the bjp-led government attributed its â€˜â€˜successâ€™â€™ in ensuring peaceful passage of the day in ayodhya on friday to two factors: the attorney generalâ€™s submission in the supreme court, and a cabinet secretariat official heading the ayodhya cell, shatrughan singh, receiving the shila from ramchandra paramhans in ayodhya. â€˜â€˜i canâ€™t say we have made any gains, but we have made no losses either,â€™â€™ a senior minister said. clearly, the symbolism of the countryâ€™s seniormost law officer pleading the vhp case, and the pmâ€™s representative facilitating shila daan went some way towards appeasing the vhp/rjn, and made a climbdown in the scale and nature of the ceremony possible. government sources said singh was deputed to receive the shila after it was realised that faizabad commissioner anil guptaâ€™s receiving it might be interpreted as violative of the apex court ruling. gupta is the official receiver and custodian of the acquired land. besides, gupta had become a hate figure with the vhp/rjn as he had imposed the curbs in the town, and paramhans wanted â€˜â€˜someone importantâ€™â€™ from delhi to receive the shila which will now be in the custody of the faizabad district administration till the title suit is decided. but the isi and caste factors also seem to have helped. the vhp appears to have been persuaded into recognising that there was a serious threat from isi-backed terrorists and unless the ceremony build-up was reduced, the terrorists might â€˜â€˜infiltrateâ€™â€™ its ranks, cause trouble and damage its image. as for the caste factor, not just external affairs minister jaswant singh and former up chief minister rajnath singh but even former prime minister chandra shekhar was roped in to persuade paramhans, a thakur, to withdraw his suicide threat. at the end of the day, the pm telephoned governor vishnu kant shastri to congratulate him for his handling of the issue and expressed his appreciation of the state administration in controlling the situation in ayodhya and the state. but this clearly is not the end of the story. the vhp wants kar sewaks to go to ayodhya on march 24 for the conclusion of the purnahuti yagya.

ahmedabad: till the other day, it was believed that only a censor can filter information before it is published. but for the time being, jailers in gujarat have taken up the job and doing it magnificently. yes, for the past few weeks since the communal violence erupted, jailers in the state are sieving the information published in newspapers before it reaches jail inmates. considering the communally surcharged atmosphere outside the walls, the inspector general of police (jails) has sent a circular to 22 jails in the state including two central jails under his command to take appropriate measures to prevent anything ''communal'' in nature from taking place inside the four walls. one of the steps taken by jail authorities in this direction was to supply censored information to prisoners so as to prevent misuse of a particular piece of information by anyone to whip up communal passions. ""we are closely monitoring newspapers and striking out all communally sensitive news items that could vitiate an inmate''s mind,"" says l v kharadi, superintendent of sabarmati central jail, ahmedabad. ""thankfully, we don''t have any cable connection,"" adds khardi in a lighter vain when asked about the impact of news channels. jail authorities, who had also planned to segregate inmates on the basis of faith to eliminate chances of possible friction, dropped the plan later on for want of space. but detainees held under poto from godhra and palanpur have been provided separate accommodation to prevent them from mixing with regular inmates. jailers have also held special briefing sessions for inmates immediately after the riots broke out. jail authorities now heave a sigh of relief as no communal incident has been reported so far from any of the 22 jails in the state. ""gauging the disturbed situation outside and its likely effect on inmates belonging to different faiths, we have decided not to take any chance,"" h r ghelot, igp (jails) told tnn. without completely ruling out the possibility of skirmishes between inmates because of the situation outside, ghelot said jailers have been asked to be on guard till the situation outside becomes normal. ""even in foreign jails, there are incidences of racial clashes so precaution is essential,"" says ghelot. according to sources in the jail department, alterations have been made inside the high security prison within the sabarmati central jail premises housing some hard-core criminals and underworld dons. in vadodara, central jail authorities have taken extra precautions to defuse any tension even before it could develop into a scuffle.

941,730,"ahmedabad/vadodara: after purchasing hockey sticks and baseball bats to save their homes and hearths, the hapless majority community of gujarat has been reduced to wearing religion on their sleeves. overnight, homes, shops and business establishments have sprouted posters that announce which community the owner and proprieter belongs to. jai shri ram and posters of hindu gods have now become tickets to survival for those who live in mixed localities. the precaution is well thought of. when rioters started burning shops in ahmedabad, owner of mehfil restaurant could not help cursing himself. in a last ditch attempt, he put a board outside his shop, which said: â€˜â€˜jai shri ram. proprietor-partner rg singh and balwant singh.â€™â€™ mehfil still stands intact. on the main samjuba hospital road of bapunagar, the all-glass bajaj showroom was spared only because of shri ram written prominently on the glass. the phenomenon is most pronounced in naroda-patia, where hindus and muslims live cheek-by- jowl in a labyrinth of shanties. since the gruesome massacre of february 27 in which 75 people were killed, only a handful of hindu families remain. the fear of being caught in the crossfire drove away the rest. those who stay have no option; and they are letting the world know they are hindus. there is no way one can miss a hindu home here. the difference is marked. houses bedecked with posters of gods and goddesses stand intact amid blackened shells that were once homes. elsewhere, while â€˜â€˜jai shri ramâ€™â€™ is the most favoured mantra to survival, a combination of vegetables, apparently, does the trick as well. in fact, as the riots ended, many shopkeepers sprinted for chillies and lemon â€” a time-tested combination to hang outside shops. garments shops along c g road â€” with names that could raise an eyebrow â€” all sported strings of chillies hanging at the entrance like so many wind chimes. the humble mango leaf is suddenly in demand as well. after an automobile showroom on the sarkhej-gandhinagar highway was burnt down, satnambhai, despite lacking a specific name for his shop, lined the entrance of his garage with mango leaves. others have fallen back on simple symbols. fresh swastikas, the symbolic om and jai shri ganesh surfaced overnight on rusted shutters of mechanics and greengrocers at naroda, bapunagar and memnagar. in vadodara, a number of houses have ram inscribed on doors and shopkeepers have hung boards proclaiming: â€˜â€˜this shop belongs to a hinduâ€™â€™. others have resorted to decorating doorways with coconuts on a kalash near their doorsteps. in karelibaug, even housing societies have pasted posters of hindu gods and goddesses at the main gates.

there is no denying that india has been a victim of terrorism, including cross-border terror propagated by pakistan for more than a decade now. hence, terrorism needs to be rooted out. but i am convinced the prevention of terrorism ordinance (poto), a draconian law, is impinging on our civil liberties and secular polity. like its predecessor tada, it will be misused. the conviction rate of tada arrests is a shocking 1.8 per cent. out of the 77,571 people arrested under tada, over 2000 were let off without trial because no evidence was found against them. surely, our fears that poto will be similarly misused should be addressed. instead we have home minister l k advani saying, â€˜â€˜those who oppose poto favour terrorism.â€™â€™ this shocking statement is like us president george bush announcing after september 11, in a cowboy style, â€˜â€˜either you are with us or with them (terrorists).â€™â€™ we are with neither. let this be clear. we oppose poto but that doesnâ€™t entitle anybody to cast a doubt on our patriotism or question our nationalism. it has been argued that poto is necessary to curb terror. how did the terror attack on parliament (december 13) happen, while poto was in existence? if poto had helped strengthen intelligence functioning, could the godhra carnage have happened? what then will poto be used for? the fear is, it will be used selectively against minorities. less than 48 hours after poto was passed in lok sabha, came reports that the ordinance has been selectively and widely used against muslims in gujarat, specifically those involved in the godhra incident. sixty people, all muslims, have been booked under poto. not one of the over 800 arrested for violence in ahmedabad and other areas of gujarat, have been booked under poto. it is obvious that for narendra modiâ€™s government, crimes by the minority community are considered more heinous than those committed by the majority and therefore more deserving of stringent punishment. for modi, the systematic targeting of families and putting entire neighbourhoods on fire is evidently not an act of terror. national security is of paramount importance. without protecting the security of a nation, individual rights cannot be protected. the worth of a nation is the worth of the individuals constituting it. â€˜â€˜the right to fair trial, the right of liberty and security of person, the right to freedom of expression, the right to redress and the right not to be tortured would all be at risk under poto,â€™â€™ is a fear expressed by amnesty international. law minister arun jaitley said, poto will clearly lay out for the police, the framework in which they can operate, thus they will not be able to misuse it. i disagree. similar repressive laws in the past have been used by the police to circumvent their usual course of probe. how do we deal with terrorism then? the nhrc says, a proper strengthening of the crime investigation and prosecution machinery and criminal justice system is needed. if there are a large number of acquittals today, it is not for the lack of laws, but for the lack of proper utilisation of these laws, lack of proper investigation and prosecution, and lack of adequate number of courts to try the offences. unless this root problem is readdressed, adopting draconian laws will only lead to their grave misuse.",0,1,1,0,0

ayodhya: for the first time ashok singhal must have realised that the social movement he has been anchoring for over a decade is totally â€˜anti-socialâ€™ and even â€˜unsparingâ€™. also, underneath the chaotic excitement of ayodhyaâ€™s religiosity lies a world saturated with ignorance and hatred, a lonely, brutish place without any hope of redemption. singhal learnt this the hard way. on december 6, 1992, he claims, lakhs of karsevaks did not listen to him, and carried out the demolition of babri masjid. on march 15, he learnt even few hundred kar sevaks could not care less for him. just when the vishwa hindu parishad (vhp), at the behest of district administration, decided to cut short the yatra of shilas, kar sevaks turned restless. katiyar and paramhans were spared but not singhal. he emerged from the inner recess of digambar akhada, tried reasoning out with few hundred kar sevaks. squabbling and bickering bhakts would have none of it. he was jeered at. used to a patient audience, singhal climbed his car, and began addressing the kar sevaks. he was not allowed to speak. his itbp security guards began throwing out kar sevaks who were at their shouting best. â€œas decided, we have brought the shilas here and even you people can go and have darshan of ram lalla in batches of 15,â€� singhal began. a bearded kar sevaks, visibly upset, stood and rattled out few unprintables. luckily, it did not reach singhalâ€™s guards or even him. singhal changed tack and announced that the problem is due to media who need to be thrown out of the akhada. kar sevaks would have none of it. â€œwound of failure in constructing the temple still hurts, torment is unbearable,â€� said one kar sevaks. â€œhow long are we supposed to gather like this and do nothing,â€� he asked singhal. still atop his car, a silent, listless singhal did not know what to say. finally, parmahans ramchandra das asked him to come down. katiyar justified the anger. â€œthey are not upset with us but pseudo-secularists who are not allowing the temple to be constructed,â€� he opined. within his earshot, another kar sevaks was abusing advani. â€œhe came here, gave us hope and himself became the home minister,â€� is all that can be written. by now kar sevaks had taken singhalâ€™s promise of ramlalaâ€™s darshan in small batches seriously. a group of 50 marched towards hanumangarhi near the disputed site. chased by security men they hid in the nearby houses. stone pelting followed. kar sevaks claim police began pelting. police claim karsevaks did it. in any case, the narrow streets were strewn with stones, bricks, slippers and lathi mark on few kar sevaks one managed to meet.

mumbai: if you can''t follow the piper, go to the guy doling out the piping hot tea.

for in the quest for hayath bansuriwala, telephones are impotent and street names are irrelevant. but the chaiwala or chana vendor around the corner might prove unexpectedly knowledgeable. ``leave a message for me anywhere,'''' says this musician-on-the-move airily. ``you can tell majnu bansuriwala in juhu. or the man who writes names on rice outside the museum. or, you know the chai shop in colaba which is frequented by foreigners? leave me a note with the bearded paanwala outside. i never stay in one place for very long, but i get my messages.''''

meet mumbai''s very own rolling stone__a man whom few know by name, but many identify by melody. for everyday, this itinerant flute peddler loops through the leafy lanes of churchgate, the palio-lined streets of nariman point and the multicultural melee of colaba. his plaintive bansuri weaves into the sizzle of frying onions and the hubbub of hawkers and then moves on, leaving behind a smidgen of raag pancham or bhairavi. ``on days he doesn''t come i miss his music,'''' says sharada dwivedi, city historian and resident of the churchgate area. ``like the trr, trr of those guys who clean the cotton in mattresses and the pipes of the snake charmers, this is a sound i associate with the past.''''

hayath is one of about 50 bansuriwalas who wander the city with their distinctive burdens__ long bamboos from which sprout hundreds of flutes. while most manage a recognisable rendition of mitva, oh mitva, however, only a few venture into the realms of classical music. ``hari prasad chaurasia is the most famous bansuri player in the world,'''' says hayath. ``and i am probably the best-known on the streets of mumbai.''''

tall claim though it may be, this skinny peddler in his well-worn shirt and scuffed chappals has his fans__ ranging from shivkumar, the portly palmist outside jehangir art gallery, to veteran film-maker yash chopra. not to forget the ``kala ghoda madams''''. ``he was floating around one day and sounded so good that we asked him to play through the kala ghoda festival,'''' says jyoti poddar, one of the organisers. ``the faint, peaceful music added to the mood.''''

adds the garrulous shivkumar, ``the angrez log who came to the festival went mad over him.'''' (this streetside expert on futures and options__who sits in on the entire interview__also feels obliged to provide a running commentary for the circle of gawkers. ``ungli ka experience hai,'''' he announces of his flautist friend, and later reveals in a knowing whisper, ``this madam is writing in shorthand. for every 15 words we say, she takes down one.'''')

ironically, hayath learnt to play his pipes of peace in what is today the heart of dissonance. growing up in ayodhya, he was taught by an elderly uncle who once sold flutes in jammu. ``whenever i took the cattle to graze i would play the bansuri. it never left my hand,'''' says this 28-year-old who has never attended school. ``but when i got a job as a chowkidar in mumbai, the seths told me not to play on duty.''''

a year later, hayath was reunited with his bamboo beloved. a chance encounter with a bansuriwala planted an idea, while a rs 2000 loan enabled him to join the tribe of nimble-fingered nomads. ``just 15-20 days after i started my business in santa cruz, a man came and told me that `director saab'' wanted to talk to me,'''' he says, recalling the dreamlike episode during which he found himself playing har dil jo pyaar karega for yash chopra. ``he was appreciative and asked me to perform for a party. i was so afraid that my fingers and knees shook. i had played at some yaar-dost ke programme, but never in party-bitty.''''

of course, `party-bitties'' are no longer a novelty for the hot-with-the-hostesses bansuriwala. last dussera, this muslim from ayodhya played at a ramlila in nashik__a coincidence so rich with symbolism, it deserves a poem or ph.d. thesis. but the biggest audience that hayath reached was over the radio. ``about a year ago, i was playing near churchgate when a man called me into a building,'''' says this resident of jari mari, who first thought his precious wares were being confiscated. ``they took me to a room full of machinery and told me to play for three minutes. my neighbours even heard my name on the radio.''''

between these glamourous intervals, hayath continues to serenade the balconies and boot-polish boys of bombay. ``on sundays i sell 25 to 30 flutes,'''' he says, earnestly describing the difference between the `ladies'' and `gents'' bansuri. ``i walk about 10 km every day, and on the way i meet people.''''

of these encounters, however, one really stands out in memory. ``after his concert at the kala ghoda festival, hari prasad churasia spoke to me,'''' says a beaming hayath. ``he had heard me playing outside and complimented me. naturally i was pleased. after all, one kalakaar always enjoys meeting another.''''",0,0,0,0,0

bangalore: he surprised everyone by polling more votes than what was expected of him in the rajya sabha elections in 2000. back again in the fray, business tycoon vijay mallya, in an interview to the sunday times of india, says the congress has no choice this time but to support him given the ayodhya issue and other political developments. how confident are you in this rs election vis-a-vis 2000? given the ayodhya issue and political developments in the country, the secular parties and the janata parivar logically should be more sympathetic to get me elected rather than the bjp candidate. the congress has to make a choice whether it wants the bjp to win or an independent backed by secular parties. i find it difficult to believe the congress will support the bjp. hence, i assume they would consider my request seriously. clearly in 2000, i almost attempted the impossible. the congress and the bjp had sufficient number of votes. i was depending on a large number of independents and the janata dal. but the congress split the jd(s), admitted six besides 10 independents. so, i lost 16 votes which i was entitled to. this left me disillusioned. who were you disillusioned with â€” the congress or the janata dal? i am inexperienced in politics. at that time, i did not think the congress would split the dal and admit independents into the party. it is a lesson i learnt that political parties have the clout and muscle to do this kind of things. it was a single-point agenda for the congress and the bjp that i should be defeated. i was facing a stonewall. but the congress has now been talking about allotting even the surplus votes to its three candidates? the rajya sabha election is of preferential votes â€” first, second and so on. all votes have relevance. i can hardly believe that any congress member will vote for the bjp. i am, therefore, hoping these votes will come to me. did you meet chief minister s.m. krishna in this regard? i have met the cm and kpcc president allum veerabhadrappa and formally placed my request. they will take a decision in due course as there is still time. i am quite confident they would prefer an independent candidate to the bjp. how are your equations with krishna now as some differences had crept in during the previous rs elections? krishna and i have been friends for many years since my father''s times. he is still my friend and also happens to be my sambandhi. the question of having any disagreement or differences with him does not arise. nothing went wrong in 2000. maybe for a couple of days, there was frustration because the congress opposed me vehemently. in any healthy relationship or friendship, there is bound to be some ups and downs. otherwise, it is very artificial. your candidature is expected to put to test loyalty of mlas to their respective parties. do you think it is ethical on your part to wean them away? the procedure for rs election is well laid out. it is a secret ballot. this implies all mlas must vote with their conscience. on the contrary, i would argue it is unethical to issue a whip. it is basically impinging upon mlas'' freedom of choice. how does it feel to be in an election again? it is one of the toughest battles of my life. the mlas have to meet the aspirations of the people. since the mlas are my voters, i have to meet their aspirations. they tell me if you are elected, you are entitled to certain grants. what is going to be your policy on the allocation of these grants to our constituencies development. will you help us in projects, attend functions? there are so many questions and issues for which they demand an answer. it is a major learning curve for me. this is something that i completely missed in the past. do you think you can do justice to the mp''s post if elected, given your vast business? how many are full-time politicians? there are many mps in parliament who are businessmen. on the contrary, if i am elected, it will keep me in india for a longer time.

""to capture the essence of a man, his body language and personality, who has never been known to display emotion vividly, was challenging,"" neelabh says. and so it went. dubyaman''s duniya expanded rapidly, from ''noo yok'' to afghanistan and pakistan and even india, as he flew about the world in his bid to banish evil, ""tripping over his tonsils every time he opened his mouth."" alarmingly enough, dubyamanitis turned out to be highly contagious and threatened to spawn a clutch of home-grown dubyamen â€” vajpayeeji, advaniji, and even jaswantji â€” all on the verge of acquiring the dreaded combination of ignorance, aggression and intolerance. jug used dubyaman to comment on the gujarat riots, the ayodhya tangle, the dna test fudge-up in jammu and kashmir...the list goes on. the strength of the strip lay in being fast-reacting, taking up events almost as soon as they occurred. the hate mail started pouring in almost immediately and readers'' comments began appearing alongside the strip. jug â€” or rather the strip â€” was accused of being anti-us. but jug is unfazed. ""you can either hate it or love it. but you can''t ignore it. that is how it should be in the business of communication,"" he says. so how long with the strip run?

964,764,"new delhi: jehadi groups in pakistan and underworld dons like dawood ibrahim, chhota shakeel and abu salem are planning terror attacks against those they hold responsible for killing muslims in the recent communal riots in gujarat. this has been learnt from several reports received by intelligence agencies recently. the intelligence bureau has submitted a report to the government including the prime minister on the matter. the report says some of the targets are functionaries of the gujarat government including chief minister narendra modi, some police officers of the state and leaders of pro-hindu organisations. ayodhya along with symbols, institutions and gatherings of hindus are also part of their planned targets. the report says pakistan-backed terrorist groups operating in jammu and kashmir see the prevailing scenario as an opportunity to make recruitments for their respective outfits from amongst muslims who have been affected by the riots. this is expected to enable these organisations to extend their activities to regions beyond kashmir. the groups have decided not to claim responsibility for any terrorist act perpetrated under this arrangement, since it could have an adverse impact on the pakistani establishment, the report says. the ib has learnt from reliable sources that jehadi groups, particularly lashkar-e-taiba, have deputed their cadres to plan and organise shootings and explosions in ayodhya. pakistani nationals are supposed to act as spearheads for such terror acts, in tandem with some local muslims. there are also reports of firearms including ak-47 rifles, grenades and explosives being moved from south kashmir to designated areas in up and nearby areas. in fact, there are indications that sahaba sainik, a bangladesh based pro- let group, has plans to infiltrate 800 of its supporters from bangladesh into the north-east to perpetrate terror attacks. the assessment of the intelligence agency is that whereas it took the underworld a few months to organise the â€˜â€˜retaliation to the demolition of the babri masjidâ€™â€™ in 1993, this time the response may be even quicker since experience of recent years has shown easier access of terrorist outfits to weapons, explosives and other hardware on account of caches that are believed to have been created in different parts of the country. both the pmo and the home ministry are believed to be agitated about the reports and are said to be monitoring the situation. they have asked the administration in up, gujarat and other sensitive areas to be on the alert on this account.

ayodhya: as vhp-sponsored shila daan programme passed off peacefully on friday, role of few behind-the-scene operators who helped defuse the crisis and brought peace to the temple town, came to the fore. two ias, an ips, a raja and a bjp mp were part of a core team which burnt midnight oil in ayodhya to save the nation from 1992-like situation. their task, of implementing sc order and saving a precious life which, if floundered, would certainly have unleashed an orgy of violence all over the country, was both ticklish and arduous. the moment news of rjn chairman mahant ramchandra paramhans das threatening to end his life was flashed, the core group went into action. the raja of ayodhya, bimlendra mohan pratap mishra, a die hard mahant follower, set the ball rolling by rushing to the vhp workshop and sending an sos to navneet sehgal, former faizabad dm and now the suda director. both sehgal and the raja held initial round of talks with mahant das persuading and cajoling him to withdraw his threat. but when mahant reiterated his resolve on thursday eveningâ€™s press conference, messages were flashed to the pmo and mha. also, posting of harbhajan singh as ig zone came at the right time. the cool sardar also joined in while faizabad commissioner took control of the pmo and mha hotlines. local bjp mp vinay katiyar was requested to mediate on behalf of mahant das. though the commissioner had offered a compromise package early on thursday, it failed to cut much ice following mahant dasâ€™ threat. serious negotiations started in the night. nothing seemed to be working initially. infuriated mahant even refused to attend prime minister and kanchi peace-maker jayendra saraswatiâ€™s calls. workshopâ€™s phone number 32835 was flooded with std calls from corridors of powers in delhi and religious heads all over the country. but nothing moved the mahant. after second rounds of talks, an annoyed mahant put up a â€˜donâ€™t disturbâ€™ board outside his dingy, poorly-lit room at the workshop and retired. but sehgal, harbhajan and katiyar continued deliberations. sehgal kept moving in and out. mobile was not working due to jammers installed at disputed rjb complex. he frequented commissionerâ€™s office and the nearby karsevakpuram to keep 7, race course and mha updated about the developments. the compromise formula was finally worked out at 1.00 am and an approval was sought from the prime minister and union home minister. tightlipped, sehgal, harbhajan and katiyar left the workshop, without uttering a word. but their body language was a clue enough that they had succeeded in their efforts. approval came with the arrival of shatrughan singh, a senior official of the cabinet secretariat, heading ayodhya cell in the pmo. he also called up the commissioner to confirm. and when the shila daan programme ended peacefully, there were smiles on all faces. after darshan of ram lalla and shila pujan at undisputed barasthan, mahant das withdrew his threat. â€œit was a team effort,â€� said commissioner a k gupta. â€œit was all due to godâ€™s grace,â€� retorted sehgal. â€œeven though we risked some on-the-spot decision, thank god the worked,â€� said harbhajan triumphantly. â€œas a citizen, we had only made an effort to save ayodhya and thereby the country. â€œno political strings attached,â€� smiled the raja of ayodhya. â€œthe programme was altered in the interest of the country,â€� shrewdly replied katiyar.

""itâ€™s a bad time for muslims in india because of the growing sense of insecurity and vulnerability,"" says imtiaz ahmed, the well-known sociologist at jawaharlal nehru university in delhi. ""the big challenge ahead is the need to understand that communalism cannot be fought with communalism. alternate approaches are essential, but the present leadership will not allow it."" indeed,many problems stem from a leadership which is neither representative nor empathetic. instead of encouraging the community to break out of mental and physical ghettoes, these masters of manipulation feed fears and suspicions. ""bodies like the all india muslim personal law board (aimplb) and the haj committee claim to speak on behalf of the community, but are monopolised by a handful of upper-class, upper-caste muslims who want to safeguard their positions of power,"" says anwar alam,an academic with jnu,who presented a paper on the need for democratisation within the muslim community. ""they have deliberately fostered a culture of blind obedience and stifled dissent by raising the hoax cry of â€˜islam in dangerâ€™."" concurs m.a. kalam, a wellknown anthropologist with the university of madras, ""anybody who dares question their stand is attacked."" even the smallest deviation from orthodoxy is greeted with shrieks of protest, ensuring that larger issues are left unchallenged. ""i recently started a column for a hindi newspaper, but it was discontinued after three weeks,"" says mr ahmed, who unwittingly ruffled feathers while responding to a question about whether it was okay for a muslim to touch the feet of an elder while saying salaam. ""i explained that while salaamâ€™ is a religious tradition, touching feet is a valid cultural tradition.this caused a huge uproar.there is just no room for debate within the community."" little wonder, then, that only reactionary voices are heardâ€”and so tend to define the â€˜muslim standâ€™ on critical issues like ayodhya. ""you will oftenfind hindus disagreeing with the vhp. but you rarely find muslims publicly objecting to the stand of the all india muslim personal law board,"" says mr ahmed, who has filed a case in the supreme court, protesting about the governmentâ€™s willingness to negotiate with the likes of the vhp and aimplb, but not with the other, liberal factions. ""ayodhya is irrelevant to the average muslim. but these leaders insist on projecting it as an issue central to the identity and existence of indian muslims."" this exploitation of emotive issues worries many observers. ""the muslim political leadership tries to create symbols of identityâ€”like muslim personal law or the status of urduâ€”and then uses them to whip up sentiments,"" says s. zainuddin, a sociologist with aligarh muslim university. concurs mr alam, ""these symbols create the sense of a single â€˜indian muslimâ€™ identity and hide the immense diversity in the community."" the kaleidoscopic nature of the indian muslim community was highlighted by numerous anthropological papers presented during the three-day-long seminar. so, for example, the dudekula muslims of andhra pradesh, whose women wear kumkum and who name their children after consulting their horoscopes, have little to do with the conventional stereotype of the indian muslim. likewise, the banjara muslims of deccan have virtually nothing in common with the matrilineal moplahs of kerala or the trader bohras of gujarat. ""in muslim gujarat alone, there are 130 categories listedâ€”from the sunni vohra to the khatri and mussalman,"" says journalist praful bidwai, who was one of the speakers at the seminar. ""itâ€™s important to emphasise this pluralism."" cultural differences apart, fairly strict caste system holds swayâ€”ensuring that a sheikh or syed is unlikely to marry qureshi or bagban. ""when i started discussing these aspects, i was accused of being an agent of the bjp and trying to create dissension in the community. i was told that islam doesnâ€™t recognise castes and inequalities,"" says ali anwar, a journalist who has written extensively about the often pathetic plight of muslim obcs. adds mr ahmed, ""all fundamentalist movements thrive on the notion of a monolith. so, both the orthodox muslim leadership and the vhp want to project the community as a single unit."" liberal muslims believe that the only way to counter the disease of fundamentalism is by injecting strong dose of vitamin dâ€”acknowledgment of diversity, democratisation and debateâ€”into the community. ""it is essential to create an alternate voice,"" says mr ahmed. ""after 1992, a few liberal movements did spring up. i, myself, go from town to town, district to district to conduct meetings in the community. sometimes i am greeted with anger. but at least tradition of debate is taking shape in the community. this is an important first step to a liberal, secular future.""",0,0,0,0,0

""while we should be happy, the opposition is unhappy that (that the challenge was overcome)."" malhotra said a meeting between finance minister yashwant sinha and the mps will take place on the passage of the finance bill as they felt that the middle class has been hit by the reduction in the tax rebate from 20 per cent to 10 per cent. he said the anti-terrorism bill replacing poto is likely to be brought before rajya sabha on wednesday. if the upper house does not approve it, a joint session of parliament is likely to be convened this week as six months would lapse if it does not get parliamentary approval this month. the bill was passed by lok sabha on monday night with a key ally trinamool congress staying away from the house. related storiesÂ poto faces hurdles in rajya sabhaÂ anti-terror ordinance passed in lsÂ trinamul abstains from voting

983,1066,"new delhi: the fact that the shila daan ceremony went off without any last-minute hitch is a reflection of the extensive behind-the-scenes manoeuvering of the last few weeks in an effort to arrive at a negotiated settlement to the ayodhya dispute. the past two weeks have, in fact, seen the pmo fan out and contact several religious leaders from different akharas and maths as far removed as rishikesh, haridwar, udipi, puri and kanchi. for officials in the pmo, it was a do-and-die situation considering that both state and central governments have toppled over this temple issue. not only have they been on a damage control exercise by speaking to religious leaders from different walks of life but they personally supervised events as they unfolded in ayodhya on march 15. at 2 pm, a phone call from ayodhya informed a top aide that mahant ramchandra paramhans, ashok singhal and kar sewaks have set-off with two shilas from karsewakpuram. at 3.15 pm another frantic call asking that orders be issued for two kar sewaks to be allowed at a time to walk up to digambar akhara. instructions are dutifully relayed back to the concerned bureaucrat. a stampede must be best avoided. fifteen minutes later, the shilas was handed over to pmo observer shatrughan singh and everyone was breathing a sigh of relief. the prime ministerâ€™s tactful handling was greatly appreciated. infact, he is referred to as pragnya sitha (one who is not disturbed by what goes on around him). he even met the kanchi kamakoti shankaracharya swami jayendra saraswati four times, and is reported to have thanked him vociferously saying, aap ne bahut baada kaam kar diya (you have helped civil society by helping to start a dialogue between the different factions). in the same way, a key pmo official held several low profile meetings with mujahidul islam oasmi, president of the muslim personal law board (mplb)and an expert on shariat law. oasmi was then admitted to apollo hospital and the meetings -vp singh style- were held there. home minister advani was anxious that mumbai-based muslim lawyer yusuf muchala, who has been cross-examining him for the liberhan commission, be involved in this dialogue. muchala was contacted and is known to have had several meetings with the kanchi shankaracharya. pmo officials interacted closely with the rss and especially madan das devi who played a key role as an interlocutor between the government and the vhp. the rss are not keen that the vhp gain too much mileage from this issue. once the supreme court had given its verdict on thursday, the pmo knew their entire effort had to be focused on molifying paramhans. advani, defence minister george fernandes and s gurumurthy were called into the act to ensure all confrontation with the centre was avoided. in december 1992, when thousands of kar sewaks were winding their way to ayodhya, vajpayee chided them with the words. â€˜â€˜you must remember you are not going to lanka. you are going to ayodhya, a city where there can be no yodha,â€™â€™ he said in several of his public meetings. buty december 6 proved him wrong. the country is waiting to see if the kar sewaks and the vhp will heed him now.

987,1093,"new delhi: shadowed by ayodhya is history of very different sort in the making: an indo-central asian republics glaciologists workshop, which ended friday, is said to have marked the first time that a security-sensitive government allowed foreign glaciologists in for possible official collaboration. this first international conference, organised by jawaharlal nehru universityâ€™s glacier research group and sponsored by the union governmentâ€™s department of science and technology. eventually, representatives from three central asian countries made it here: kyrghyzstan, uzbekistan and kazakhstan. tajikistan experts were invited but couldnâ€™t reach here in time. india was looking for joint research projects, says a k kalra, advisor in the department of science and technology. some glaciers, had been identified for further detailing â€” among these, on the indian side, are the pindari and hamtak (in hp) glaciers. avalanche forecasting is one possible area india may get some help on, says kalra. indiaâ€™s record in glaciology has been poor so far, says syed iqbal hasnain, professor, jnuâ€™s glacier research group. it doesnâ€™t have the resources, the expertise or the trained manpower. â€˜â€˜we have hardly covered a few glaciers,â€™â€™ says kalra. yet, given the realities of climate change and glacier meltdowns, glaciology is becoming a vital field â€” the glacier ice mass in the himalayas is the third largest in the world, after the greenland and antarctic ice sheets. major rivers, such as the ganga, brahmputra and indus, originate in the himalayas. so, the flow of water in north indiaâ€™s rivers will determine lifestyles in the future â€” it will decide the requirements for water supply, agriculture use and hydropower. it will determine the frequency of natural disasters such as floods. one area of focus has been the gangotri glacier â€” it feeds north india and it is the only major basin entirely within the indian system, besides being religiously significant for millions. hasnain says the global change in temperature in the 20th century was 0.6 degrees celsius but the past two decades have seen average temperatures rising by upto 10 degrees celsius in himalayan glacier regions. the duspou glacier in tibet, he says, has seen temperatures rising by 0.35 degrees celsius at 7,000 metres elevation. therefore, the need to cooperate with countries such as those from central asian which, with nearly 30,000 glaciers spread over 78,000 sq km, have both skills and stations. in addition, they have contiguous ranges and similarities in conditions. and, their own shopping list to fill the gaps in their own experiences.

lucknow: even as the vhp top brass is holding a high-level meeting in ayodhya, cracks seem to be appearing in the ram janmabhoomi nyas (rjn) hierarchy. rjn chief trustee mahant dharam das is contemplating filing a case against nyas chairman mahant paramhans ramchandra das seeking court directions for his removal and declaring the march 15 shila daan programme in ayodhya as illegal. the rjn chief trustee is making the centre a party in the case and a request is being forwarded to return the two shilas to the rjn workshop. the two shilas were donated by the paramhans to pmo osd and ayodhya cell head shatrughan singh on march 15. terming the controversial shila daan programme as â€˜vhp dramaâ€™, dharam das has stated that no consent was obtained from the rjn to hold the programme. â€œthe decision to hold the programme was to be taken at the march 14 meeting of the nyas. but neither was the meeting held nor any decision taken in this regard. it is violative of the nyas constitution to hold any programme in its name without even consulting its members,â€� rued dharam das. moreover, he added, the shila daan programme was held against vedic shastra. â€œno hindu religious programme is held in the month of kharmaas, but shila daan was fixed for march 15 which fell in the inauspicious month. moreover, there was no need for holding it again as the shilanyas had already taken place in 1989,â€� he contended. dharam das has been at loggerheads with the paramhans since 1986 when the latter took over as rjn chairman after the death of swami shivaramacharya. â€œsince then he has been forcibly occupying the chair,â€� the chief trustee charged. seeking removal of the paramhans, he has demanded that an urgent meeting of ram janmabhoomi nyas be convened to decide all contentious issues, including misuse of nyas funds, allegedly by the nyas chairman and vhp working president ashok singhal. â€œover rs 2 crore were spent on march 15 shila daan programme. hindus all over the world are making contributions for the construction of ram temple, but the fund is being misused by them,â€� he alleged. mahant dharam das also levelled certain serious allegations against the rjn chairman. â€œa history sheet number 22-b is there in his name in ayodhya kotwali and many criminal cases are pending against him,â€� he charged. with the rjn chief trustee filing a case against the nyas chairman, the fight within the nyas has come out in the open and it may become a cause of worry for both the vhp and rjn, spearheading the ram temple construction movement.

hyderabad: how safe is it to blindly trust neighbours? not very much, if one were to hear about the arrests made by the abids and amberpet police on thursday. the east zone police arrested a couple and a housewife who were caught stealing their neighboursâ€™ property. in the first case, the abids police arrested a 22-year-old housewife meena patil after she stole property worth about rs 10 lakh from her neighbours.the police have recovered rs 4,26,700 in cash and a gold necklace worth rs 24,000 from her possession. meena patil, a native of gujarat a resident of troop bazaar, had allegedly committed two thefts. the first one was at the house of her former neighbour sreelathaâ€™s house and the second one at the their neighbour sanjay gawlekarâ€™s. the woman committed the thefts when the inmmates of the house were away. according to deputy commissioner of police (east) c v anand, although the police suspected her involvement in the first theft, they got proof only after she committed the second offence. â€œsanjay gawlekar is a businessman and he used to affix his signature on the notes. so when the notes were found with meena patil it was easy for us to establish her guilt,â€� he said. meenaâ€™s husband who had set up a tiles showroom in sultanbazar pleaded ignorance about his wifeâ€™s activities. asked what she had done with the remaining amount, meena said she had sent it to her parents in gujarat. similarly, the amberpet police arrested shanker and his wife, residents of jaiswal garden, for allegedly stealing 11 tolas of gold worth rs 45,000 from their neighbour n gouri shanker. the stolen jewellery has been recovered by the police.",0,1,1,0,0

kolkata: the sangh parivar outfits are damaging the prime ministerâ€™s credibility and vajpayee should be cautious about it, feels trinamul spokesman sudip bandyopadhyay. and to isolate itself from the parivar-inflicted damage, the trinamul congress is distancing itself from the nda. statements made by the top trinamul leaders over the past fort-night on major national issues are more in tune with an opposition party than with those from a member of the ruling alliance. on issues like godhra, gujarat riots and ayodhya, the trinamul has stridently opposed the nda. as the party was not in a position to vote for poto on monday, it stayed away from the lok sabha, even disregarding an nda directive to be present. trinamul chief mamata banerjee has been scathing in her criti-cism of the railway and general budgets, even accusing the va-jpayee government of giving concessions to the rich at the cost of the poor. bandyopadhyay does not mince words while explaining his partyâ€™s hardening of stand vis-a-vis the nda, especially the bjp. â€œwe want to drive home the message that the government at the centre is not a bjp government. we have come together on the basis of the common minimum programme and this must be fol-lowed,â€� he asserted.",0,0,0,0,0

ahmedabad: the earthquake shook gujarat for a day but the aftershocks of the godhra carnage have left the state''s industry paralysed for the past one month. the story is the same for all sectors of the economy be it manufacturing, services or agriculture. state industries minister suresh mehta pegs the overall economic loss at rs 600 crore. but industry bodies put it at over rs 2000 crore and above. these exclude losses due to direct damage caused due to rioting. gcci president kalyan shah says the loss to trade has been about rs 1500 crore, loss to industry around rs 600 crore and loss to small businesses about rs 100 crore. gujarat region chairman of the basic chemicals, pharmaceuticals & cosmetics export promotion council (chemexcil) satish shah estimates a total loss of around rs 1500 crore in domestic and export sales, with export losses alone constituting rs 750 crore. ""the gujarat government estimates are lower being restricted to the five to six days'' industrial production loss immediately after the godhra attack. they haven''t considered losses to the service and agriculture sectors and losses due to non-availability of transport for the past one month. at kandla port, goods are lying in warehouses and ships carrying goods for exports from the port are waiting, with demurrage costs mounting daily, as the goods to be exported are not arriving,"" explains cii senior director sunil parekh. hotels and restaurants association of gujarat president jehangir cama pegs the total direct loss to the hospitality industry at rs 125 crore. occupancy levels in hotels graded 3 star and above, which used to hover around 50-60 per cent during march, have plunged to 12 to 15 per cent this month. he puts the total consequential loss close to rs 200 crore as transportation has gone haywire and interstate buses have not been plying. ""i would expect normal traffic to resume only four to six weeks after normalcy returns and by the time we recoup our losses it would be another 12 months,"" adds cama. cinema halls and multiplexes wear a deserted look, too. according to multiplex and theatre owners, the reason is more because of the distributors refusing to take the risk of releasing new movies. the state has seen no new releases in the past one month. city pulse, which used to do a business of around rs 30-40 lakh per month is actually losing rs 50,000 to 75,000 per day. occupancy levels are down to less than 10 per cent, according to ashok purohit of city pulse darshak mehta, head of fun republic, says business is down by half. ""our average monthly business totals rs 2.5 crore. but we have managed to make only around rs 1.4 crore during this month that too on account of the clearance sale."" varsha dave, manager (administration), city gold, says business is down from rs 3-4 lakh per day to rs 10,000-20,000 per day. occupancy levels at the movie screens are down from 60-70 per cent during weekdays to 20 per cent and that from weekends from 100 per cent to 40 per cent. not only were several cars burnt down by rioters, the sale of cars in the state has also dropped by 70 per cent causing a loss of around rs 200 crore to the automobile industry. leading car dealers estimate that as against the average sale of around 3,000 cars a month only 1,000 cars have been sold in the state. consumer electronics and tv manufacturer''s association president rajeev karwal estimates losses at rs 50 crore.

new delhi: prime minister vajpayee''s gujarat visit next week may spell the beginning of the end of narendra modi''s dispensation in the state, well placed sources in the government say. continued violence even after his delhi visit, his defiant demeanour and his shooting from the hip at the media, the political opposition and even parliament have made modi''s position untenable, these sources point out. though unofficial, the announcement of vajpayee''s visit a week in advance has acquired political significance. the message is that the pm has decided to ignore the pressures from the sangh parivar to retain modi despite the allegations of partisan performance of his government machinery. for starters, the centre may ask governor s s bhandari to send a report on the situation in gujarat to begin, belatedly, the constitutional process. that this has not been done for over a month has not been lost sight of by political observers and constitutional experts familiar with past actions of the union government of the day. for the ruling bjp, which initially saw gujarat as a testing ground for hindutva, the charge of there being a nexus between the violence and the movement for the ram temple in ayodhya is embarrassing for its long-term plans. that violence has spread to the rural areas is seen in official circles as something unprecedented and a dangerous trend. a change of guard in gujarat is seen in bjp circles as a way to remove an unpopular chief minister and replace him with somebody more acceptable to do the fire-fighting required for the elections next year. modi''s performance has embarrassed the government, which earlier this week had to take note of british foreign secretary jack straw''s statement. although diplomatically worded to refer only to two missing british nationals, the statement did cover the need for communal harmony and for peace. sources in the opposition and even within the ruling nda point to the gross incongruity in the centre''s constitutional behaviour. that the same party (bjp) dominates the government at the centre and runs the government in gujarat, coupled with a senior member of the sangh parivar holding the gubernatorial post, has permitted a measure of political sanguinity that has now become the talking point in political circles. for instance, it is pointed out that even when the congress enjoyed power at the centre and in the states, at times with senior partymen in the raj bhavans - a situation misused to political advantage by all concerned on numerous occasions - violence of a political nature, so widespread and ferocious and so prolonged, was never permitted. according to durga das basu''s treatise on the constitution, article 356 was utilised precisely a 100 times till 1997 and since then, another five times. defections, either local or organised from delhi, altered the numbers in the legislatures to cause constitutional breakdowns in several cases. but in a majority of the cases, such breakdowns caused law and order situations that needed to be quelled by imposing president''s rule. gujarat itself has had four spells of president''s rule. the last one in 1996 saw then governor krishna pal singh dismissing the bjp government a day after it proved its majority support on the floor of the house and installing the congress-supported government of shankersinh vaghela. the outcome of this experiment was that the bjp romped home with a two-third majority in 1998.",0,0,0,0,0

bangalore: faith is a personal experience with no labels, no tags. it takes seed within and demands that we look inward in a spot of self-introspection. it is a journey into the recesses of our being to arrive at the answers we seek. faith is soul-searching, revealing to us that often the answers to life''s perplexing and worst dilemmas lie within, if only we would take time to search, unlock doors to explore and arrive at a better understanding of ourselves, our actions, our goals. the recent ayodhya imbroglio and the days, weeks of blood-letting, communal riots, ruthless and mindless slaughter of humans at the hands of humans in full display of the world, the 9/11 holocaust last year and the subsequent us backlash are ugly examples of what happens when faith turns into a spectacle rather than an inward experience. in contrast, the build-down in ayodhya on march 14, when peace and goodwill prevailed over the ram bhakths breathing fire and brimstone till then, is a glowing demonstration of introspection, to give them the benefit of the doubt. it an an example of pausing amid the mayhem to search for answers within themselves. and the fallout to that happy ending, even if temporary, is the ring of solidarity holding together a nation divided till yesterday, in a maternal clasp, reminding us of vasudeva kutumbakam (one god, one family), of unity in diversity. it''s a world of black and shades of grey. even amid religious animosity which divides and kills to establish the stranglehold of religions over people, there are any number of stellar examples of individuals speaking the message of unity from their little corners, and making an impact. closer home, in bangalore, there is swami udai shankar, on a ""mission"" to sanitise society as far as his reach goes, by strengthening the hands of youths and bringing about a change of heart in them. udai shankar says he has healing powers and can see into the future from where he is. he claims he had predicted when the hostages aboard the hijacked plane in kandahar would be released and he was right. and when rajkumar was kidnapped two years ago, he had hit the bull''s eye once again on the day the thespian would be released, he claims. but he likes to believe he is different, distancing himself from the league of godmen and saints. he is comfortable as simply udai shankar, dropping the `swami'' prefix to his name. he says he is a human crusader, the ""channel"" of a superior force who has invested him with the powers. his god is humanity and his religion service, wherein he draws the inspiration to live and go about his calling of infusing quality to life. a corporate guru? udai shankar fits the description to a `t'', as he juggles a corporate job during the day with godspeak and healing in the evenings. an automobile engineer who has worked in leading companies the world over, udai shankar is the general manager of a leading automobile showroom in bangalore. he strives to strike the right chord in a world beset with problems by blurring lines that divide. all in good faith.",0,0,0,0,0

1005,1195,"new delhi: with central observer shatrughan singh accepting the shila (carved stone) from ramjanmbhoomi nyas president mahant ramchandradas paramhans outside the acquired land, the imminent threat in ayodhya may have been defused, but tempers are only rising in the capital's political circles. opposition parties are objecting to the participation of a government official in a religious ceremony. describing singh's participation as ""a very important development,"" opposition parties have said that such things should not happen in a secular state. accusing the vajpayee government of pandering to the vishwa hindu parishad's agenda, opposition leaders say that the issue is likely to affect parliament proceedings, with all opposition parties voicing concerns. shatrughan singh, who was the government's appointee to receive the shila from the mahants, may not be the statutory receiver of the 67.7 acres of government-acquired land, but is still a government official. moreover, as the head of the ayodhya cell attached to the prime minister's office, his presence was seen as a direct extension of the pm himself. senior cpi(m) leader somnath chatterjee confirmed a united opposition would take up the matter in house. the congress too criticised the acceptance of the shila by a senior government official. ""while the congress welcomes the fact that the law of the land has prevailed in ayodhya, one fails to understand the role of a government official in a purely religious function,"" said congress spokesperson jaipal reddy. while the authorities have argued that accepting the shila outside the acquired land would not violate the supreme court orders of march 13, the opposition is seeing the participation of government officials as capitulation to the vhp's obduracy. congress president sonia gandhi on friday made a blistering attack on the government in the lok sabha on the ayodhya issue charging it with openly collaborating with vhp in the wake of threat of ""dire consequences"" from bjp mps. meanwhile, the government, expectedly, received words of praise from both the bjp and the rss. the bjp praised mahant ramchandra das paramhans for abiding by the sc verdict which disallowed symbolic puja at the undisputed site in ayodhya. bjp spokesperson v k malhotra said, ""despite all attempts to provoke him, the paramhans stuck to the law of the land."" the bjp also praised the government for ensuring that the situation stayed under control. ""the party now wants that the ayodhya issue should be solved through dialogue between the hindus and the muslims. the bjp will welcome the role of the shankaracharya as well as the muslim personal law board,"" malhotra said. the rss went a step ahead, consequent to the shila daan ceremony. it has now said that the entire disputed land should be handed over to the ramjanambhoomi nyas for temple construction. earlier in the day, commenting on the government decision to appoint the faizabad divisional commissioner as the receiver of the shila, somnath chatterjee wrote to the pm, saying: ""it is highly objectionable that a government official and particularly one who is representing the statutory receiver appointed by the court, should participate in such a ceremony which, even if held outside the area mentioned by the supreme court, will be against the spirit of the order."" chatterjee also said in the letter: ""if such a donation is accepted, then it is nothing but the government taking part in a religious ceremony which has become extremely controversial."" he requested vajpayee to issue ""appropriate instructions that no government official should take part in any such ceremony or function."" related stories sc judgements:

""if we are pushed beyond a point, we will not tolerate this. this yatra is going to be a very dangerous affair. when we joined the nda, it was decided to keep issues like mandir-masjid, article 370 and common civil code out of the government agenda. that is not happening. besides, gujarat continues to smoulder,"" said d p yadav. a tdp member added that rss and vhp should not be allowed to dictate the governmentâ€™s agenda. attacking the vhp, yadav said it did not represent more than 2 per cent of the hindu population in the country. ""we are bound by our secular credentials and are answerable to the secular people of this country."" samata party member raghunath jha said his party believed in the secular credentials of the prime minister, but he ought to take steps to rein in ""these people before it is too late.""

""there is no way you can evaluate the damage to the mosque,"" says afzal khan of the sunni muslim wakf board, under whose jurisdiction the muhafiz khan masjid fell.

ahmedabad: his frail body is bent over at almost a right angle, but he dismisses any polite inquiry about his health by saying ""i have never felt so fit"". at 97, prof keshavram kashiram shastri, looks quite a vulnerable old man slouched in a chair in the verandah of his house near mithakali. but looks are deceptive and once he starts speaking, it is a confident man with clear thought that comes across. he, after all, founded the vishwa hindu parishad in gujarat in 1964 and still continues as it''s president till date. among his many titles and the 110 books that he has to his credit, he is happy to point out that the padma shri was received during indira gandhi''s regime. ''keka'' shastri, as he is better known, has seen it all since 1905 when he was born in mangrol in junagadh district. and he says the current animosity between hindus and muslims was primarily a post-partition phenomenon which started in ahmedabad and has now spread to the whole state. while he calls the godhra train attack as ''pre-planned'', he is also quick to point out that the backlash all over the state was ''spontaneous''. ""this (post-godhra riots) was tit for tat and this tidal wave of destruction was needed,"" he says. shastri says he feels for the first time hindus from all sections had outpoured their anger over what happened in godhra. ""the mobs consisted of people of cultured families for the first time, besides the poor and the lower classes who have experienced riots often in the past,"" he says. this, he said, was such a groundswell of anger and retribution that it just wasn''t possible for the government to control it. ""narendra nirdosh chhe"" (narendra is innocent), he says about the chief minister''s role in the riots. ""if there is anybody to blame for letting things out of control it is p c pande (the police commissioner) who showed slackness in this whole episode,"" says shastri. asked whether the police was slack because the bjp and its government was backing the ''bandh'' on february 28, he replied, ""the bandh was supposed to be a means of protest, but nobody planned or imagined violence on this scale, it was the duty of the police to control the mobs. did you expect narendra to go to pande''s residence and tell him to control the situation?"". shastri says in every riot in gujarat, it is the muslims who have provided the first spark, like it happened in godhra.

gandhinagar: succumbing to pressure from the nda allies on the bjp-led government at the centre, the gujarat government on friday decided to defer implementing provisions of the prevention of terrorism ordinance (poto) against the accused of the godhra train massacre till investigations prove they are terrorists. so far, the police have booked 62 people in godhra under the ''draconian'' law. friday''s move sent shock-waves through a section of the state police, which thought the blanket use of poto against all accused in the train massacre would help investigations as well as prosecution. while the move has apparently been taken on the directions of the centre, chief minister narendra modi said in a statement that the decision was taken after obtaining legal opinion of the advocate general. the legal opinion says, ""it would be advisable to prosecute the accused under the general laws, and the application of poto could be deferred till the investigation is complete."" modi said the state government had, therefore, asked the godhra district superintendent of police to prosecute the accused of the massacre under general laws and the ipc. ""if on investigation the facts constituting offence under poto are prima facie established, the prosecution can also be proceeded or pursued under poto, if thought fit,"" he said. the chief minister''s decision is being interpreted here as a direct result of the hue and cry in parliament that poto is being selectively used against the godhra accused and not against the perpetrators of the post-godhra riots. despite the step backward, modi sought to present a bold face, indicating he was forced to take the hard decision as ""a very systematic and organised attempt is going on to malign the government of gujarat with regard to the godhra incident and its aftermath."" he claimed, ""those who are indulging to create the hue and cry against the gujarat government are doing it with a specific objective to malign and defame the government."" the chief minister said, ""allegations are being made that action has been taken only against those involved in the godhra incident, whereas no action is being taken against those involved in subsequent incidents. those making such allegations are doing it maliciously without verifying the facts. ""more than 10,000 arrests, including preventive ones, have been made till now. necessary action and arrests in all major incidents have been taken in a very prompt manner."" to substantiate his point, modi said, ""twentynine people have been arrested in the naroda incident, 18 in the gulbarg society case, 46 in the sardarpura (mehsana) violence, and 27 in the pandarwada incident."" he added that statements have been made by prominent persons that no action has been taken in these cases. such statements, besides bringing bad name to the government, fuel suspicion in the minds of the people which in turn becomes a stumbling block in attempts to restore normalcy. this is the second time that the bjp government in the state has had to go back on its discriminatory outlook towards the godhra incident and the subsequent riots. earlier, it had announced a compensation of rs 2 lakh for the godhra victims and rs 1 lakh for those killed in the post-godhra riots. however, that decision was withdrawn and a uniform compensation of rs 1 lakh announced after protests.",0,1,1,0,0

ahmedabad: the state government on saturday decided to postpone the ssc and hsc board examinations in the commissionerate areas of ahmedabad and vadodara which were scheduled to start from march 18. fresh dates will be announced shortly by state education minister anandiben patel. the decision has been taken in view of the recent disturbances in the two cities and the distinct view of the district administration and police that it will be extremely difficult to provide security to all examinees under such a situation. earlier on friday, the government had announced that while examinations would be held as per schedule from march 18, those who are not in a position to take the exams next week would be given another option of appearing in the alternate exams scheduled from may 6. however, following pressure from parents and politicians of the ruling bjp, a decision to postpone the exams has been taken in the urban areas of ahmedabad and vadodara. however, exams would begin, as scheduled, in other areas of the state from monday. altogether, about one million students are scheduled to take the examinations and there were apprehensions that while the situation was not at all conducive in many areas, many students had lost their books and belongings in the riots and were not able to study in temporary relief camps. the state had earlier come up with the compromise formula of holding two exams - one from march 18 and the other from may 6. but in the wake of violence breaking out in the city on friday, the state finally gave in and postponed the exams till a further date. the fresh dates will be announced after reviewing how the situation remains when the exams begin on march 18, highly-placed sources in the secretariat told tnn. in all probability, the exams will be scheduled in the second week of april, sources indicated. students who were supposed to write exams in centres in sensitive areas of the city like shahpur, dariapur, gomtipur, bapunagar and juhapura have heaved a sigh of relief. ""i am happy that the exams have been postponed. i was very scared to go to the exam centre at gomtipur. now, i hope that the situation will cool down and we will be able to write the exams in peace,"" said shveta shah, a standard 10 student of saraspur. jinal kanani too was happy that she was spared the torture of having to go to gomtipur to write her ssc exams. but there is a catch here. jinal''s uncle kamlesh bhavsar said that while the postponing of exams is a welcome decision, this is definitely not the end of the problem. ""our main opposition was giving the exam centre in gomtipur. the exams will be postponed by 10 days or a maximum of 15 days. but the situation is not going to improve by then. if our children are given the same centre, we will oppose and will not refrain from moving the court,"" said bhavsar. meanwhile, demands have been pouring in to postpone exams in other areas of the state as well. the gujarat pradesh youth congress (gpyc) has demanded that exams should also be postponed in panchmahals, bharuch, balasinore, chhota udepur and other parts of the state which were equally affected by riots and continue to re-main tense.

""is this deliberate or to cover up or to present make-belief situation which otherwise stands not only improbable but totally absurd?"" the bench asked, and noted ""the state governmentâ€™s advocate has answered the same in silence rather than on a definite note"". in another case, a bench, comprising justice m b shah and justice d m dharmadhikari, again dismissed the gujarat governmentâ€™s appeal against acquittal of one vakar ahmed abdul hamid sheikh, who was arrested for the same offence and tried on the same evidence for which the apex court had dismissed the governmentâ€™s appeal relating to another accused in 1997. following the dismissal, the state government arrested sheikh and his associates. the designated judge, valsad at navasari, which ordered acquittal earlier, again acquitted sheikh and others in 1999.

jamdudhai: ""i am not the custodian of the vajpayee government nor am concerned whether it stays in power or not. the ram mandir will be constructed at any cost. the government can go if it cannot fulfill the wishes of the people in india,"" said international general secretary of the vishwa hindu parishad (vhp), pravin togadia. in an exclusive interview to this correspondent here, togadia blamed the pseudo secularism and indian polity for the present crisis in the state. excerpts from the interview: why did the vhp give up its hardline stand on ayodhya at the last moment? pt: the vhp has always stood for tolerance. the vhp is not a militant organisation and we haven''t given up our stand. besides that, the vhp has achieved what it had intended. some people wanted the vhp to continue this hardline stand so that there could be bloodbath in ayodhya and then they could renew their demand for a ban on the vhp. the vhp went according to its plan without offending the supreme court ruling and also avoided the bloody clashes which many desired. now that the first stage of the vhp programme is over, what is the future plan of the vhp vis-a-vis temple construction? we would like to have a central legislation enacted, allowing construction of ram temple at ayodhya according to vhp plan. we plan to have a public opinion in favour of the ram temple. we want the government policies to be pro-ram and not anti-ram. all out efforts would be made to garner public support for the temple construction. the temple issue has not been solved and we won''t settle for anything less than a ram temple irrespective of the court verdict. the court cannot decide the future of the hindus in hindustan, and whom to worship and where. did the parliament and the supreme court change its stand on the shah bano case and if yes, then it will have to change for the construction of the ram temple also. do you regret the violence, post-godhra? the post-godhra violence was a natural reaction for the attack on the yatris on way to amarnath, attack on sabri mala in kerala, attack on hindus in jammu and kashmir. for the gujarat violence, i would blame the pseudo secularism and indian polity. india has followed a one-way secularism. the secularism has not defended the hindus but has defended the muslims and islam. the indian polity is slave of muslim vote bank. this is the last chance to change the indian polity and if it does not, there would be godhra-type incidents everywhere in india. to avoid such happenings, the government must be of the hindus and for the hindus. in this difficult times, why does the vhp want to rock the vajpayee government? i am not a custodian of the vajpayee government. i do not care if the government stays or goes. vajpayee had promised construction of the ram temple, but when the time for its implementation came, he backtracked as he wants to stay in power. no one can stay in power without the support of hindus, and who are we to rock the vajpayee government? the people will themselves turn it upside down if the wishes of hindus are not fulfilled. how to govern the alliance (nda) is not the concern of the vhp. we want the temple to be constructed. the government can go if it cannot fulfill this wish. how would you term the violence in gujarat? you cannot call it violence. it was a natural outburst of the merciless killing of innocent ramsevaks in godhra. what else one can expect when such an incident takes place in front of your eyes. it was simply tit for tat.

lucknow: even as the build-up in ayodhya had the entire nation on tenterhooks, there were some who were actually benefited by the vhp â€˜potboilerâ€™. the bharat sanchar nigam limited (bsnl) being one of the â€˜beneficiariesâ€™. case in point: expansion of the wireless in local loop (will) telephone services and usage of the leftover equipments. conceding that the tension in ayodhya had rung in good tidings for the bsnl, the chief general manager up, east telecom circle, sp kalsi told times news network on friday that the department, courtesy the tension in the temple town, had managed to sell more than 60 of its will mobile systems in the twin cities of faizabad-ayodhya in the last fortnight alone. these instruments, sources said, were a spillover of the initial phase of will connections when the scheme was thrown open for public in the state capital on august 1, 2001. senior bsnl officials said that while they were mulling over ways to do away with the surplus instruments left after the closing of the deadline for the scheme, the ayodhya issue gained heat which came as a boon for them. the ayodhya-faizabad telecom circle is reportedly poor in mobile communication, as the sole service provider of mobile services in this region has poor phone network and connectivity is a big problem, said officials. it was here that the state government officials approached the bsnl top brass to come to their rescue, which they willingly did, much to their benefit. according to reliable sources, over three dozen will mobile connections were taken in the twin cities by government officials, which included bureaucrats from lucknow, commanding officers of central paramilitary forces like the crpf, bsf, cisf, raf and the local police. and the second highest users of the will services was the fourth estate which according to information available with the cgms office requisitioned around 11 sets, the rest of the demand basically came from influential businessmen of the temple town. confirming the upswing in the demand for will connections in the region and the benefit to the bsnl, sp kalsi said they were happy to note that â€œin a situation of crisis like this they were able to perform their duties as communicators well enoughâ€�.",0,0,0,0,0

new delhi: the ongoing violence in gujarat and chief minister narendra modi''s recent remarks blaming the communal incidents on the statements being made in parliament cast a shadow over the rare joint sitting of houses convened here on tuesday for the passage of the prevention of terrorism bill. the joint sitting, being held after a gap of 24 years, was delayed by 20 minutes as angry opposition members made noisy protests, objecting to the handling of the gujarat violence by the state government, especially the chief minister''s remarks. members from the left parties, rashtriya janata dal, samajwadi party and the muslim league, were on their feet as soon as the joint sitting was called to order. anti-government and anti-poto slogans echoed through the high domed central hall, the venue of the joint sitting, as deputy speaker p m sayeed made repeated appeals for peace. home minister advani, called by sayeed to move the bill, was prevented from doing so by the protesting opposition members. rjd leader raghuvansh prasad singh charged to the podium to register his protest and it was only after 20 minutes of uproar that advani could make his opening speech. almost all opposition leaders referred to the gujarat carnage during the debate on poto and were particularly critical of the chief minister''s utterances and his handling of the violence. the congress also gave a notice of breach of privilege against modi for his reported remarks that violence in the state would end only after the parliament session concludes. aicc general secretary kamal nath, who gave the notice, said these and other remarks of modi amounted to a ""great assault"" on parliament, especially the lok sabha where members cutting across party lines have expressed concern over the gujarat situation. ""the proceedings of parliament and the right of members to express their views have been questioned and the derogatory remarks by the chief minister are clearly a breach of privilege of the members of the house,"" he said in his notice. he demanded that this ""extremely serious matter"" be referred to the privileges committee immediately.",0,0,0,0,0

mumbai: itâ€™s a tug-of-war between the powerful fishermen lobby and marine conservationists. the issue here is the ban on the hunting of sharks for their fins. the marine conservationists, led by organisations like mumbaibased reefwatch marine conservation (rwmc) and sanctuary magazine, are marshalling their resources to agitate against the modification of the july 2001 order which had put all sharks on schedule i of the wildlife act (which meant a blanket ban on their hunting), while the shark-fin export lobby is adamant that they will not stop hunting sharks, ban or no ban. at stake here is the survival of not only sharksâ€”the species that occupy the apex position in the marine ecosystemâ€”but even fragile marine life like groupers and coral reefs. responding to the intense agitation by marine scientists and conservationists, the union ministry of environment and forests brought a wide range of marine species including all types of sharks, corals, sea horses, sea fans, giant groupers and molluscs (shells) under the wildlife protection act in july last year. this was the first time that indiaâ€™s marine life had been placed under protection. the euphoria didnâ€™t last long. under pressure from the influential shark-fin export lobby, the government recently modified the ban, leaving out almost everything except nine species of sharks, citing socio-economic factors as a justification. says sarang kulkarni, marine biologist with rwmc, â€œthese are the commercial type of sharks. they are not as important in the preservation of the ecosystem as the oceanic and reef sharks that have been left out.â€™â€™ conservationists say that indiaâ€™s marine life is facing an sos-like situation. â€œindia, today, is the largest exporter of shark fins to the far east, which has depleted its resources and is now looking towards our shores. sharks are hunted for their fins, used to thicken soups in restaurants across the world and even eaten as a delicacy by indiaâ€™s rich and famous,â€™â€™ says mitali kakkar, director of rwmc. â€œsometimes, fishermen throw back live sharks into the sea after cutting off their fins, forcing them to die a painful death by drowning since sharks need fins to swim.â€™â€™ during recent coral reef survey projects conducted by reefwatch and united nations development project, no shark sightings have been recorded. considered the tiger of the ocean, sharks help maintain the marine ecosystem. any imbalance in their population affects fish stocks and ultimately the resources and livelihood of thousands of fishermen who are dependent on the marine wealth. kulkarni reveals that in malwan, on the konkan coast, he discovered even baby sharks finding their way into the nets of big trawlers.â€œwe have seen shark fins the size of a thumbnail being dried,â€™â€™ he says. â€œso you can imagine the size of the baby sharks that are coming into the nets off the coast of maharashtra and goa.all the money from shark hunting goes to the middlemen and not to the small fishermen.â€™â€™ arguing against the conservationists are the government and fishermen lobbies of coastal states like maharashtra, goa, kerala and gujarat, who say that the livelihood of several fishing families depends on shark hunting, which accounts for almost five per cent of indiaâ€™s total exports. â€œfish stocks like pomfrets, mackerel, sea salmons are down,â€™â€™ claims vijay bandarkar, president of the maharashtra macchimar kruti samiti. â€œwe have no choice but to catch whatever gets us returns. ultimately, you canâ€™t talk about ecological conservation when the livelihood of so many fishermen is at stake.â€™â€™ indeed, the issue at stake here is not only the survival of sharks but also the subsistence of a few lakh fishermen. pollution combined with fishing by foreign trawlers who, unlike traditional fishermen, catch fish even when they are spawning thus preventing juvenile fish from reaching maturity, has depleted stocks. conservationists admit that entire traditional coastal communities are on the brink of starvation and have no choice but to fish for products like shark fins which sell at about us $20,000 per ton in the international market. the solution probably lies in finding alternative means of livelihood for fishermen and restoring the ecological health of the seas. protecting predators at the apex is a part of this plan. â€œwe do not want to rob the fishing community of their income,â€™â€™ asserts kakkar, â€œthat is not the idea at all.â€™â€™ in malwan, for instance, reefwatch is conducting a survey to check if eco-tourism can be encouraged as an alternative. even in gujarat, where hunting for whale sharks is a major issue, the organisation has initiated a three-year project that suggests whale and shark watching expeditions as an eco-tourism activity, where fisher folk can use their boats to take tourists to watch whales. other long-term solutions could include cordoning off certain breeding grounds for a period of 3 to 5 years so that fish stocks are rejuvenated. â€œthese could be opened for fishing activities after the lock-in period and another area could demarcated. there has to be a clear earmarking of trawler fishing zones so that they do not interfere with traditional fishing zones and take away from the catch of the smaller fishermen,â€™â€™ points out kakkar. â€œin this way, we can ensure sustainable fishing resources and practices.â€™â€™",0,0,0,0,0

1054,1165,"vadodara: the khaki uniform, the stars and the medals, the lathi and the bayonet â€” nothing seems to evoke awe anymore. the police have seen a complete erosion in their authority in recent weeks despite rattling off statistics about how many rounds of fire and teargas shells they used to push back riotous mobs. as gujarat plunged into mayhem following the godhra carnage on february 27, the police lost their authority and also the faith the people had in them. so much so that even 20 days after the riots began, the mobs have no qualms in lynching their victims despite the police cover given to them. the erosion of faith perhaps began on day one itself, when an angry mob went on an assault-and-stabbing spree at vadodara railway station on february 27 as the ill-fated sabarmati express chugged in in even as 50 to 60 policemen watched. from then, till sunday evening, when an escort party of six policemen, three of them armed, virtually stood and watched a mob lynch two persons of the minority community and injure 20, the image of the police has been on a downslide. former city police commissioner jaspal singh, who is now with the samajwadi party, says: â€˜â€˜in this complete breakdown of the law and order machinery, the image of the police has got so badly battered that mobs are now killing their victims right in the presence of these men who donâ€™t have a leader left in the police force to inspire them.â€™â€™ â€˜â€˜the escort team on sunday was outnumbered by the mob that kept surging and swelling. they did resort to a lathicharge, but to no avail. we were left at the mercy of the mob,â€™â€™ said an injured person. he was one of the people who had fled their houses in the makarpura area of vadodara after february 28 and had returned to collect their belongings when the mob attacked them. and, the aggrieved now cut across communities. if a mob comprising women from the minority community gheraoed vadodara police commissioner d.d. tuteja on ajwa road on sunday, a huge group of women took to the streets on saturday afternoon despite curfew, singing ram dhun and protesting against alleged police excesses on the men folk of the salatwada area. two women were injured when the police burst teargas shells to disperse them. the lawlessness that gripped vadodara was also apparent when a group of tribals fired at the district collector and the superintendent of police recently when they were on a round in kawant taluka. what has further dented the policeâ€™s image is the interference by the political class, with bjp functionaries being seen at a number of places, â€˜â€˜guidingâ€™â€™ policemen on the street on â€˜â€˜how and where to actâ€™â€™. and, the ram dhun singing crowds too were virtually left untamed on friday. they meandered menacingly close to known sensitive areas and the policemen on duty did not act despite their provocative slogans that triggered fresh bouts of rioting.

mumbai: imagine a scenario in which the recent bloodletting in gujarat has been secretly filmed by aliens in their flying machines. from the footage, what verdict would the little green men pass on us humans? that we love to burn our trains? that we love to drive in fancy cars as we go on looting expeditions? wouldn''t they be right in concluding that humans are nasty, brutish and tend to hide snarling faces, red in tooth and fang, beneath their smiling masks? many would regard such an indictment as bang on. curiously, such a view is not alien to anthropology either. ""with the early provocative description of australopithecus as a lustful killer and the appearance of konrad lorenz''s on aggression in 1967, the origins of violence became a central theme in debates about human social evolution,"" says frans b.m. de waal, a primatologist and author of the bestseller the ape and the sushi-master. ""popular authors (like robert ardry and desmond morris) spun the now familiar scenario according to which inborn aggressiveness, combined with male bonding in hunting and warfare, ''explains'' the human success story. ""the extraordinary appeal of this ''killer ape'' myth has been attributed to the horrors of world war ii,"" mr de waal adds. ""confidence in human nature was at a low after the war, and the view that we are murderous psychopaths, or a mentally unbalanced predator, threatening an otherwise harmonious natural realm, went down remarkably easily with scientists and the general public alike."" that extreme portrayal began to change with inputs brought in from the field by ethologists. these experts found that primate societies are characterised by cooperation. some species such as chimpanzees and humans did indulge in bouts of collective intercommunity violence. but more often than not, alliances were formed within the group, with two or more individuals banding together to defeat a third. as a result, high-ranking individuals were not necessarily those who were the strongest, fittest or most violent, but those who could mobilise support and foster valuable partnerships. at the same time, the way in which scientists look at the social impact of conflict also changed. earlier, research had focused on appeasement and reassurance gestures and had hinted at relationship repair after fights. ethologists presumed that primates evolved social graces to temper their aggression, as a way of kissing and making up after a fight to preserve group cohesion. reconciliation became the buzzword. ethologists believed that reconciliation allowed monkeys and apes to maintain tight kinship bonds despite frequent intrafamilial squabbles. but recent research has overturned that view. ""monkeys and apes are rather nice to each other most of the time,"" reports new scientist, ""and not just to make up after a fight."" at a recent conference organised by the american association for the advancement of science (aaas), paul garber from the university of illinois at urbana-champaign said few of the researchers who claim that social behaviour originated as a way to make up after a fight have actually examined how animals interact. by scouring existing data, dr garber and his colleagues measured the time spent on being social versus time spent on being aggressive. they found that old and new world monkeys and apes, as well as pre-simians like african bush babies and asian slow lories, spend only about five per cent of their time in any kind of social interaction. what''s more striking, aggression chest-beating, biting, scratching and other mayhem accounts for an extremely small percentage of these social interactions, usually less than one per cent. friendly behaviour is 20 times as common. according to dr garber, this suggests that social graces may be valuable in their own right. other studies also suggest that primates only make an attempt at reconciliation after fewer than one in five conflicts. this could also mean that as an evolutionary force, pure friendliness may be more potent than reconciliatory or obsequious behaviour. this is precisely what the sage of sabarmati, mahatma gandhi, preached. what we mustn''t forget is that the communal carnage occurred in the very state where he was born.

kolkata: the interrogation of dubai-based don aftab ansari has shed some light on the motives behind the american center attack which left five policemen dead. the attack was actually planned by amir reza khan, brother of asif reza khan, who was killed in an encounter in gujarat. amir, who is also an aide of aftab ansari, wanted to avenge the death of his brother. amirâ€™s strong sentiments over his brotherâ€™s death suited aftabâ€™s purpose, which is why he agreed to provide logistic support. this was the gist of his â€˜confessionâ€™ to the police, deputy commissioner (detective department) soumen mitra said on monday. according to mitra, aftab had a twin objective â€” to create an atmosphere where his name would strike terror, similar to that of dawood ibrahim. he perceived that the terror tag would help in the extortion of city businessmen and also to establish his credibility among the jehadis. however, he was not averse to exploiting the jehadisâ€™ cause for his own gains. â€œaftab had plans to exploit the jehadis in the toughest of operations,â€� he added. the american center attack was a difficult assignment. there was every chance of getting hurt or even killed and so aftab preferred to exploit men who were fired with enough zeal. he therefore sought out two pakistani jehadis, idris and zahid, to carry out the firing on police personnel. in a shrewd move, aftab chose the american center, which would have been a natural choice for the extremist lashkar-e-toiba or jaish-e-mohammed. aftab has reportedly told the police that amirâ€™s insistence on revenge led to â€œunnecessary hurry,â€� resulting in â€œsome basic flawsâ€� in the operation. aftab claimed that he was not in favour of attacking the police. after this revelation, kolkata police sleuths compiled charges against amir in the case. as he was still in dubai, they have forwarded the necessary documents to the cbi to start extradition proceedings. mitra said that soon after asifâ€™s arrest, amir fled to dubai. from there, he acted at the behest of aftab. asifâ€™s death proved to be a blow to aftab as far as his underworld business in india was concerned. he relied on amir. through him, aftab contacted his men like nasser, sadaqat and abdulla alias khoram khayam and asked them to provide logistic support for the action. amir was in sharjah at the time of the attack and informed aftab about the â€œsuccessâ€� of the assignment. aftab told the police that amir was in touch with the attackers. aftab, in turn, called up a newspaper and a cid officer claiming the responsibility. quack lynched: a quack was beaten to death on suspicion of being a witch by residents of ballu gopalpur village in murshidabad district on monday.",0,0,1,0,0

ayodhya: after its two-day crucial meeting in ayodhya, the vhp said on thursday that the nda government was dominated by so-called secularist forces and the country urgently required a â€˜pro-hinduâ€™ government which would serve the interests of the majority community. the vhp said that the present government was working against the interests of majority community. â€œwe require a government which serves the interests of hindus,â€� said acharya giriraj kishore, the vhp general secretary. as for public posturing, the vhp turned its ire against the allies instead of the bjp. â€œtill bjp is in the clutches of nda, it canâ€™t talk of hindutva or take up the temple cause,â€� said kishore. â€œdonâ€™t say that it was said by vajpayee but by a pm. when a father becomes king it is not imperative of him to always discharge duty of a father,â€� he said, when asked about pmâ€™s statement on vhp working president ashok singhal in parliament. â€œthe rss and its outfits may have different agenda but they are all one on issues concerning nation,â€� kishore, however, hastened to add. although vhp did not unfold its plans for temple construction, it emphatically said the religious programmes would continue peacefully as per schedule. it was being speculated that after its march 15 flop show, the vhp would announce some action plan to renew its temple construction movement. but, instead, it just said that it would continue with purna ahuti yajna till june 2 and may not undertake any programme which might violate the march 13 court order. on the request of the centre and the district administration, the vhp has also decided to allow limited number of jap sadhaks to participate in the ongoing 100-day-long purna ahuti yajna. only 2,000 jap sadhaks would participate daily in the yajna as against the proposed number of 20,000. on the temple construction programme, the vhp general secretary said that â€œfollowing the apex court march 13 verdict, the vhp has no alternative than to abide by it.â€� both vajpayee and l k advani came under fire from vhp leaders during the two-day meeting.

mumbai: it will be a black day for democracy if the joint session of parliament votes in favour of prevention of terrorism ordinance (poto) on tuesday, say activists and concerned citizens here.

although the government has dropped some sections of the ordinance since it was promulgated six months ago, those opposed to it say that the changes are cosmetic and that poto can be misused just like the terrorist and disruptive activities act (tada), which lapsed in 1995.

civil rights activists point out that a total of 77,571 people were detained under tada, of whom 72,000 were eventually let off because of lack of evidence. gujarat accounted for the maximum number of tada arrests (18,686), way ahead of states such as punjab (15,314) and j&k (11,616) where terrorists were active. and, the overall conviction rate under tada was less than one per cent.

``poto gives the government sweeping powers and there is every chance of it being used selectively,'''' says former state education minister sadanand varde, pointing at the gujarat government''s decision to apply poto in the godhra case but not in the horrific riots that followed. he feels that the existing laws are sufficient to combat terrorism if the government shows enough will.

advocate yasmin shaikh says that such draconian laws are used against the minorities, as was evident during the 1992-''93 riots in mumbai. according to her, this ordinance does not check the police and it will make it easy for them to victimise people or extort money from them.

``the government will simply get hold of a weapon to use against dissenters, trade unionists and other critics,'''' said former high court judge s.m. daud.

opponents of poto contend that draconian laws have not been able to stop terrorism. they point out that terrorists attacked the j&k assembly and parliament house despite poto being in force and that the neither the godhra incident nor the ensuing riots could be prevented. civil rights activists said that the government was in favour of harsher laws, despite a total lack of accountability on the part of the police.

``poto does not define terrorism and we will have to accept the government''s definition of terrorism,'''' said teesta setalvad of people''s union for human rights. she is also opposed to sections in poto that allow the police to arrest anyone withholding information about terrorist activities.

justice daud pointed out that it is virtually impossible to establish if a police officer has applied poto maliciously as the government itself sanctions the arrest.

advocate b.k. subbarao said this ordinance makes it impossible for the judicial system to come to the rescue of poor victims. ``the law-enforcers will be above the law,'''' he said.

according to shakil ahmed of nirbhay bano andolan, the government should counter terrorism by providing better training and tools to policemen. ``why don''t they invest in police reforms, in forensics, in computerisation?'''' he asks.

ahmed said several people arrested under tada are still languishing in jails, even though they have not been convicted. he feels that people similarly arrested under poto will never be able to claim compensation from the government.",0,1,1,1,0

lucknow:what was a satisfactory moment for the atal behari vajpayee government and the secular forces was an hour of reckoning for the vishwa hindu parishad-led ram janmabhoomi temple movement in ayodhya. as the restless karsewaks and sadhus jeered and heckled, ashok singhal, the working president of vishwa hindu parishad, vinay katiyar, the bjp mp, and mahant ramchandra das paramhans, the president of the ram janmabhoomi nyas, stood completely discredited. the refrain was that these three leaders of the temple movement were nothing more than confidence-tricksters and that no hindu will respond to their call in future. as singhal stood atop his car trying to explain the reasons for surreptitiously performing the shila daan to pmoâ€™s emissary shatrughan singh instead of the commissioner of faizabad division, one could see how ineffective he was in his attempt at winning back some of his, and that of the paramhansâ€™s, lost credibility. out of frustration and to avoid millions watch and later read about the embarrassing situation, singhal ordered the media out of the digambar akhada precincts. not so with vinay katiyar and the paramhans. katiyarâ€™s bravado was typical. nothing has been lost and the temple movement is right on course, he said while being surrounded by some media personnel and a couple of agitated karsewaks. whatâ€™s next? that he did not want to disclose. â€œjust wait and see.â€� asked if the concernsâ€” supreme courtâ€™s order, bloodshedâ€” that prevented them from carrying out their threat would not come in the way of temple construction in future too, katiyar quite unusually said that everything would be done peacefully. the paramhans, whose fickleness had kept the administration on tenterhooks the whole of march 15, was emphatic in his own interpretation of success of his plan and was confident that â€œnobody can stop the temple from being constructed.â€� he did not elaborate how. where do you go from here? â€œi am too tired and want to rest so iâ€™m putting the phone down.â€� by the end of the day, karsewaksâ€™ and sadhusâ€™ disappointment had given way to disenchantment with the temple movement. going by the sentiments of those in ayodhya and faizabad, june 2, when the ongoing yagya is to end, may be a bigger flop show than the shila daan itself. as it is, there are no karsewaks even for the daily ahuti. and the locals believe that after the â€˜disgraceful fridayâ€™ none would be willing to come to ayodhya. the temple movement does appear to be disintegrating, unless fridayâ€™s drama was enacted keeping in mind some other opportune moment or a long term strategy. the ram janmabhoomi nyas itself is a divided house. its vice-president, mahant nrittya gopal das, has been conspicuously absent from the nyasâ€™ activities. as he is away from the scene of activity, one doesnâ€™t know the reason for his aloofness. the nirmohi akhara headed by jagannath das is certainly not very happy at the way the vhp has hijacked the temple programme. it was the nirmohi akhara that had filed the first case way back in 1884 for putting up a canopy on the idols of ram and sita. they had lost the case but were allowed to bring the idols at the break of dawn and then remove them at sunset. with the akhara politics exposing the mahantsâ€™ disunity, and political expediency and supreme courtâ€™s order thwarting vhpâ€™s game-plan this time, it would require a 1991-92-like frenzy to be rebuilt for the vhp to get the people to ayodhya once again. but then a mob can only destroy, whereas ayodhya needs reconstruction. in this sense, the vhp appears to have reached a dead-end on the construction of ram temple in ayodhya.

""we have started the connectivity, quality of education and computer literacy project under which the gcert would have an intra-net facility. already, we have tried out the facility by giving training to teachers in kutch sitting here in gandhinagar. soon, the training would be given to teachers in six districts of ahmedabad, vadodara, jamnagar, surendranagar, junagadh and sabarkantha.""

hyderabad: the assembly proceedings were stalled on saturday for an hour as speaker k pratibha bharati rejected adjournment motions sought to be moved by bharatiya janata party and the majlis-e-ittehadul muslimeen parties to discuss incidents of violence in the old city. as soon as the house assembled on saturday, the bjp and mim members moved an adjournment motion to discuss the incidents of violence in the old city as a fallout of the shila puja in ayodhya on friday. however, the speaker denied permission and appealed to the members not to raise the issue on the floor of the house. meanwhile, home minister t devender goud requested the bjp and mim not to aggravate the matter further by discussing the issue in the assembly as it would send wrong signals to the people. goud appealed to the mim and bjp to give up their postures of being the sole representatives of the muslim and hindu communities respectively.this statement set off a strong protest from the bjp and mim members. mim floor leader asaddudin owaisi and the bjp floor leader n indrasena reddy took strong objection to this and demanded that the remarks be withdrawn. the mim legislators rushed to the well of the house and demanded that the speaker allow their party to make a statement on the issue. the bjp members too demanded their leader be allowed to rebut goudâ€™s remark. however, the speaker said that members would not be allowed to speak on the issue. and any comments made by them would not go on record. the matter was resolved with an assurance from her that the floor leaders would be called to her chambers to sort out the matter.",0,0,0,0,0

mumbai: in the wake of the ayodhya controversy, hindutva supporters in the u.s. have halted the screening in new york of two films made by noted director anand patwardhan which critically look at the ram phenomenon and hindu fundamentalism. one of the films, in the name of god, documents the rise of hindu fundamentalism as reflected by the temple\mosque conflict. the film won the national award for best documentary in 1992 and was telecast on doordarshan after a high court directive to the national network which had earlier refused to show the film. the other film,we are not your monkeys, is a music video featuring the poem of late dalit poet daya pawar, giving a dalit perspective to the ramayan story. the films were to be screened at the american museum of natural history. however, hindutva supporters brought pressure on the authorities by conducting a signature campaign and submitting a petition against their screening. in a chat with this newspaper, patwardhan said he was amused to note that the hindutva supporters had branded him a â€œself-proclaimed leftistâ€™â€™. â€œactually, i am a humanist. the fundamentalists calculated that a strategy of red-baiting would work best with the american authorities,â€™â€™ he remarked. â€œhistory teaches us that compromising with fundamentalist forces, no matter what their hue, only encourages them to become more extreme in their position. the irony of the situation is that both the films are not new ones. we are not your monkeys articulates a dalit critique of the caste system by deconstructing images and stories from the ramayan,â€™â€™ he said.",0,0,0,0,0

lucknow: to comply with the centreâ€™s directives, the two shilas, which held the whole country to ransom for over a month, were finally shifted from dasrath mahal to treasury in faizabad on wednesday. the district administrationâ€™s move may earn vhp wrath as it has threatened to launch a stir if the same were not shifted back to some temple or religious place. in a swift and secret action, a team of senior police and district officials, led by the resident magistrate, ram janambhhomi complex hari pratap sahi and the sp (city) rajendra singh, reached dasrath mahal early on wednesday morning to make arrangements for the shifting of shilas . the shilas were packed up in two separate wooden caskets and shifted to the treasury around 9.00 am. they are kept under double lock and the room has been sealed. much photographed during the shila daan programme on march 15 at ayodhya, the two shilas finally landed in the custody of the district magistarte, faizabad as per the centreâ€™s directive. the mha had sent a letter to the principal secretary (home) naresh dayal directing him to keep the two shilas under the safe custody of the district magistrate, faizabad when a controversy had erupted over their being kept at dasrath mahal. the controversy began on march 17 when dasrath mahal chief priest swami devendra prasadcharya had sought removal of the shilas as they were kept there without his permission. anti-vhp saints joined his protest and had threatened to throw the two shilas into the gutter if they were not removed from dasrath mahal at the earliest. the shifting of shilas to the treasury is unlikely to end the controversy as the vhp has threatened to launch a stir if they were not shifted back to some temple or religious place to maintain their sanctity . the state unit of the vhp has reacted strongly. â€œhow dare they shift the sacred shilas to an obscure and non-religious place like treasury,â€� fumed the vhp state president purshottam narain singh. the vhp has threatened to start an agitation if the two shilas were not shifted back to temples as suggested by them. the issue will be discussed on thursday at a meeting,to be chaired by vhp working president ashok singhal, in allahabad. â€œi have been told that the two shilas would be kept at a safe and sacred place as promised. in any case, we now need these shilas only at the time of construction so the district magistrate should ensure that the two conditions must be fulfilled till that time,â€� reacted the rjn chairman mahant paramhans ramchandra das.

mumbai:the violence convulsing the land of the mahatma has deep roots in the past, social scientists and activists say. in addition, the economic downturn, the rapidly changing social fabric and the saffron brigadeâ€™s relentless preaching of its communal ideology have tinkered with the mindset of the average gujaratiâ€”a person believed to be more comfortable doing business than brandishing swords, with a reputation for being tolerant and accommodating, experts say. the militancy by gujaratis is the result of the constant cultivation of communal ideas through literature and the educational system, says delhi-based sociologist d l sheth. ""history textbooks and gujarati literature focus on the humiliation faced by hindus at the hands of muslims, especially the ravaging of the somnath temple by mohammed ghaznavi, not once but 15 times,"" he says. ""the repressed aggression among gujarati hindus against the minorities has found voice with the bjp government power."" he says that the idea that gujaratis are peace-loving and tolerant was primarily formed by the dominance of the vegetarian jain and vaishnav communities in the state. ""but in the last 20 years, the composition cities has changed drastically with the steady arrival of migrants from other states,"" dr sheth says. ""the cities scarcely present gujarati culture or lifestyle any more."" writer and former mumbai sh e r i f f chandrakant bakshi says the gujarati psyche was fated to be transformed. ""the pendulum of history moves from one extreme another. there is no middle ground. the most submissive race or community metamorphoses into the most aggressive one,"" he claims. ""this is evident from the change in the jewish mindset, pre- and post-holocaust."" he believes that if a godhrastyle incident had occurred 50 years ago, gujarati hindus would been subdued. ""but the new post-independence generation... believes in quick retaliation, which is evident from the recent mayhem,"" he says. sociologist achyut yagnik marks the 1969 communal riots the turning point, as many secular gujaratis metamorphosed into religious chauvanists. ""civil society, literature and education the state systematically adopted a â€˜us vs themâ€™ discourse. the post-â€™69 generation of gujaratis has been raised on this communal doctrine,"" he says. ""this is responsible for the perceptible drop in tolerance levels against the minorities. it was evident during the 1992-â€™93 riots and the recent mayhem."" the post-godhra riots, mr yagnik notes, are more disturbing because of the intensified level of violence and barbarism. this is something no gujarati can explain or analyse since we are still trying to come out from the shock and revulsion,"" he says. ghanshyam shah, a professor at delhiâ€™s jawaharlal nehru univeristy, says his study of several communal riots in gujarat revealed a pattern: ""the communal riots were started by a handful of strategists and fanned agents who were skilled in using weapons and ransacking shops and houses."" he says that ordinary people were not involved previous riots and stayed passive â€”if somewhat insensitive observers. ""but what is disturbing this time is their witnessing and justifying the atrocities committed against the minorities,"" prof shah notes. ""for instance, the insistence that the minorities deserve what is happening to them."" the decline of the congress and the gradual saffronisation the state, with its accompanying propagation of the hindutva ideology, has also been responsible for the change in the gujarati psyche, social scientists say. ""gujarat has always been communal to a certain extent, partially because it shares a border with pakistan. since 1985, the saffron brigade has tried to exploit this communal feeling â€”the state witnessed the biggest mass mobilisation for the ram janmabhoomi movement and l k advani started his ayodhya rath yatra from somnath 1990,"" says mr yagnik, coauthor creating national movement: ram janmabhoomi and fear of the self. he believes the bjp government has institutionalised communal indoctrination through the educational system and the media. ""exploiting the godhra incident was the perfect technique to consolidate the hindu vote-bank,"" mr yagnik says. concurs human rights activist teesta setalvad,""itâ€™s a systematic and planned manipulation gujaratis by different agents, the vishwa hindu parishad, the rashtriya swayamseval sangh, the bharatiya janata part and the bajrang dal. they have tried hijack the gujarati culture and mindset and impose an extremely crude and macabre identity."" gujarati herself, she says gujaratis should break their silence and call the bluff of the saffron bridage, which claims represent all hindus. economic frustration also contributed to the rage. mr shah says 80 per cent of participants in the 1973 riots in the state whom interviewed told him that they were either unemployed or underpaid. ""with a significant rise in the casualisation of the working class over the last 30 years, lumpen elements available for violence have also increased,"" he says. concurs mr sheth, ""the decline of the (textile) mills in the 1980s and the high rate of urban unemployment have pushed people to vent their frustration through violence. they are also prone to communal twists vested parties.""",0,0,0,0,0

gandhinagar: chief minister narendra modi is deliberately delaying a formal decision on the issue of forming an all-party committee under the chairmanship of gujarat governor s s bhandari for rehabilitating over one lakh riot victims staying in 100-odd camps, despite a formal communiquâ€š to this effect from prime minister vajpayee. ten days after vajpayee made the announcement in the lok sabha, the lack of any follow-up on an issue of such urgency comes as a surprise. there have been several queries from the prime minister''s office (pmo) and raj bhavan. however, according to sources, the cm has not yet responded to the queries. the sources said the governor too wasn''t very keen on the formation of the all-party committee and hasn''t adopted a proactive approach to the issue, knowing that he could become the target of the opposition parties once the committee starts functioning. though the pmo sent an official note to the chief minister''s office and the raj bhavan several days ago, the cm is yet to formally request bhandari to form the committee, on which the future of thousands of displaced families hinges. ""the note sent to the cm is accompanied by the proceedings of parliament, where the pm announced the need to form the committee,"" an official said. ""the cm now just needs to send a one-line request to raj bhavan to go ahead with formation of the committee."" insiders say the file to form the committee through a formal notification has been pending with the cm for several days now. modi reportedly wants some ''pliable'' congress leaders in the committee, whereas the congress is insisting on its discretion on who to nominate to the panel. the issue also figured at the meeting of senior congress leaders at sonia gandhi''s at 10 janpath residence on friday night and the aicc president is said to have told partymen that she would take up the matter with vajpayee once again. the cm''s unwillingness to act on forming the committee comes despite his formal assurance to opposition leader naresh raval in the state assembly last wednesday that the latter would be part of the committee. raval had sought to find out when the committee would be formed. both the cmo and raj bhavan officials have now adopted a ""we don''t know"" posture. sources say never before has it happened that despite the pm''s direction, the gujarat government has treated a matter so callously. liberals within the bjp point out that any more delay in rehabilitation work would deteriorate the law and order situation further.

new delhi: having faced its worst-ever electoral defeat in recent times, the city bjp is grappling to explain its rout in the mcd polls. was it the bjpâ€™s feckless governance of the corporation or national issues which spelt its doom. how was the bjp uprooted from its traditional strongholds? in the krishna nagar assembly segment which comprises two municipal wards, the bjp has not faced a defeat in 40 years. even the onion wave in the 1998 assembly poll failed to dislodge the party. but this time, the party lost both seats by huge margins. â€˜â€˜not only did the traditional bjp voter turn against us. even the rss cadres refused to side with the bjp,â€™â€™ a party insider said. the bjp, when it first contested corporation elections as the jana sangh in the early 1950s, had won 27 seats. in 1983, when the party faced its worst nationwide defeat in the lok sabha elections, it was able to secure 39 seats in the 100-member metropolitan council. local leaders, unwilling to admit the organisational failure to mobilise voters, blame the union government for â€˜bad policiesâ€™. the central party leadership has, however, not reacted to the electoral drubbing. said a senior party leader: â€˜â€˜somebody should have owned moral responsibility for this humiliating defeat. delhi was bjpâ€™s fortress. now with 17 seats in the corporation and 14 in the assembly, we have become a political non-entity.â€™â€™ explaining reasons of his defeat, prithvi raj sawhney, standing committee chairman in the outgoing corporation â€” who lost to a congress first-timer in janakpuri â€” said: â€˜â€˜the middle class electorate who had always voted for the bjp deserted us. they were so hard hit by the union budget.â€™â€™ and although delhi bjp party president mange ram garg accepted the â€˜punishing verdictâ€™ rather â€˜humblyâ€™, he maintained that it was a â€˜â€˜collective failure of both the local and central leadershipâ€™â€™. a senior leader conceded that the godhra killings and ayodhya issue added fuel to the fire. â€˜â€˜hit by inflation, higher income-tax slabs and a cut in interest rates on small savings, people were not ready to give in to the partyâ€™s rhetoric on ayodhya. hindutva became a defeating factor for us,â€™â€™ he said. some bjp leaders said the failure of the third force to gain votes also went against their party. in the last municipal poll, the third force had polled 37 per cent votes. this time round, they got 16 per cent. â€˜â€˜our poll analyses indicate that the bjp was only able to draw one per cent of the vote which the third force lost. the rest was grabbed by the congress,â€™â€™ said a party insider. only five sitting councillors retained their seats. the anti-incumbency factor was responsible for the defeat of as many as 43 sitting councillors, sawhney pointed out.",0,0,0,0,0

1092,1050,"new delhi: acutely aware of the monumental political liability the communal carnage in gujarat has become for the bjp, prime minister vajpayee on wednesday finally cracked the whipâ€”albeit in privateâ€”telling gujarat chief minister narendra modi that he wanted the state government to prepare a blueprint to rehabilitate the 97,000 persons currently living in 101 camps before he visits the state next week. modi should take â€˜â€˜confidence-building measuresâ€™â€™, he said, by providing alternative housing to those whose homes had been destroyed by rioters and creating conditions in which those who had fled to the camps fearful for their lives, returned to their homes. till that time, the pm stressed the situation in gujarat could not be described as normal. sources said vajpayee was so unhappy with modi that when the latter asked him whether he could tell the press that the pm was â€˜â€˜satisfiedâ€™â€™ with his performance, the pm replied in the negative, saying he wanted to see how he conducted himself in the future. when modi was asked the same question by the press, he hedged, saying, â€˜â€˜it is not a question of whether people are satisfied or not.â€™â€™ pressed further, he said, â€˜â€˜everyone is satisfied.â€™â€™ vajpayeeâ€™s â€˜â€˜margdarshanâ€™â€™ came after modi made a presentation on the situation in gujarat in front of the pm and the home minister. government sources said that when vajpayee told modi he expected him to build homes for those whose houses had been burnt down, the latter said he did not have the funds to do so. the pm then told him that in that case, he should mobilise funds from private agencies as had been done for earthquake victims. modi expressed his reluctance to do so. as for providing security for those too scared to return to their homes, modi told vajpayee many were casual labourers who did not want to leave the camps as they had no jobs or money. the pmâ€™s response was that it was modiâ€™s job to create conditions in which they would get work again. vajpayee also dismissed modiâ€™s complaint that media reports were exaggerated, stressing he wasnâ€™t as concerned about the opposition or media. dissatisfied with modiâ€™s explanation that the recent transfer of senior police officers â€” who had done their job by acting against the rioters and arresting vhp leaders â€” was a â€˜â€˜routineâ€™â€™ affair, the pm said that transfers must be done in such a transparent manner that no one could criticise them. modi met home minister advani and discussed the idea of a snap poll. but the pm rejected it. related storiesÂ godhra attack not planned Â protesters call for modiâ€™s resignation Â police book two tv channels for inciting riots Â pages missing in gujarat govtâ€™s report: nhrc

surat: corruption is the use of public office for private gains and the resultant effect has now filtered down to the lowest social level affecting one and all to such an extent that there is an urgent need to address the factors responsible for promoting corruption in our country, which stands among one of the most corrupt nations in the world, according to international ngo transparency international. keeping this mind, the southern gujarat chamber of commerce and industry (sgcci) here on saturday has organised a meet, which will deliberate on the possible ways and means to reduce corruption in the society. the chief vigilance commissioner, n vittal, will give certain guidelines in this regard while delivering his keynote address on the occasion. sgcci has organised this meet in association with the surat citizens'' council trust (scct). scct chairman arun jariwala told tnn that lots of confusion prevails in the society about the sections responsible for using corrupt means for their own gains. often the business community becomes the convenient target, for conniving with the government authorities to serve their purpose in the form of tax evasion and getting the things done without meeting the statutory expenses, jariwala pointed. but, the same class also gets affected when they act as consumers in the society. hence, it would be grossly wrong to earmark a particular section for using unfair means for vested interests, he said. sgcci officials, too, pointed out that the way the democracy is practiced in the country, much space is created for corrupt practices without any check and balance for effective monitoring of the whole process. for example, the political funding is often the basis of origin of corruption, as by doling out money by an industrial house or group or even a small unit to the political parties, the tendency is to seek favours in terms of certain incentives or benefits, which would not be possible otherwise, a senior sgcci representative said on condition of anonymity. the roots of corruption are so deep that it would certainly be impossible to wipe it out at once. but, with attempts at every level, it can be reduced substantially, jariwala pointed. the unaccounted money in india is estimated to be in the range of rs 3,50,000 to 7,00,000 crore, more than the combined revenue of the centre and all the state governments in the last fiscal year, sources said quoting n vittal. corruption has not always been perceived to have a negative impact on economic development and growth, but it denigrates the performance of the system as a whole and compromises the economy''s long-term dynamic efficiency, sgcci officials explained on the basis of vittal''s observations.",0,0,0,0,0

bangalore: latur may be history. gujarat shocked us. afghanistan and japan jolted our memories anew on tuesday with an earthquake that killed 1,800 people. earthquakes rock us out of complacence but aftershocks seem to die down. while post-quake relief and deaths are matters put down on paper and forgotten, india is not doing much to prevent damage to life from non-seismic structures, says bangalore-based dr binod k. bhartia. ``in india, people are still busy discussing anti-seismic measures that have already been implemented in japan and the us 15 years ago.'''' bhartia studied, taught and worked in a land that''s been hit by the world''s most disastrous quakes. with a masters in civil engineering from tokyo university, he was a researcher in vibration-control design in a japanese company before teaching the subject at tokyo university from 1993 to 1995. bhartia''s research centred on anti-seismic devices like the tuned mass damper attached to building tops with springs. ``during a quake the damper moves, disseminating the vibrations and lessening the impact on the building.'''' in japan, attaching such devices to a building could add 10 per cent to cost of the building. in india, it would easily mean 50 per cent more than building cost because such instruments have to be imported, says bhartia. ``to manufacture such devices indigenously, you need volumes.'''' since the devices are expensive, there are not many takers. research is on currently in iits, structural research institute, chennai, and rourkee university. but manufacturers would rather invest in proven devices. another method of seismic resistance is base isolation where the building is attached to rollers at the base so that the whole structure sways from side to side during a quake and does not crumble down. japan has used this technology for the last 30 years, says bhartia. ``nearly 1,000 structures in japan are base-isolated. all newly constructed hospitals, school buildings are required to follow this method.'''' but in india, the committees that screen the design and plan of a building do not want to make this compulsory. the problem with buildings and structures in india is that they do not take into account horizontal forces in play, says bhartia. ``the recent japan quake measured 7 but there was no report of damage.''''",0,0,0,0,0

1102,1104,"new delhi: the country's attorney-general pleading the vhp case in the supreme court made the bjp-led national democratic alliance look like a government of swayamsewaks. and the tv images of the pm's 'special envoy' accepting the carved pillars for the ram temple in ayodhya, gave the ceremony the official sanction the vishwa hindu parishad desired. indeed, ayodhya's return to centrestage over the last few weeks has presented the bjp's partners in the nda with their most serious ideological dilemma to date, given that all of them - barring the shiv sena - profess a commitment to secularism. on friday, it appeared as though the partners who had raised ''serious'' objections to the a-g's role, were willing to forgive the participation of a government representative in the shila daan ceremony. they all declared themselves satisfied since the court ruling banning any activity on the acquired land had been upheld, the administration had made enough arrests to prevent any concentration of karsewaks in ayodhya, and the day had passed off peacefully. but on saturday, after the vhp claimed that the acceptance of the shila by a government official indicated that its demand to start construction of the ram temple had been accepted, both the telugu desam party's yerran naidu and the tc's mamata bannerjee asked the pm on the floor of the lok sabha to clarify whether this claim was indeed true. clearly, the nda partners are torn: on the one hand, they are willing to overlook the bjp's lapses because the reasons that brought them together in 1998 hold true even now. in 1996, ideology kept them apart when the vajpayee government collapsed after 13 days; in 1998, they came together largely because of electoral compulsions, with the congress being the main rival for most of them in their own areas of influence. with the congress juggernaut marching steadily across the indian map, this is even more true today. on the other hand, it is becoming increasingly difficult for the allies to justify the position the bjp has been taking on the ayodhya issue to their own muslim constituency - they must, at least, appear to be keeping the bjp on its toes. so given this conflict between ideology and practical politics, what would be the breaking point for the bjp's allies? as samata party spokesperson shambhu srivastava put it, ''any violation of the supreme court order or failure to uphold the rule of law would have had serious implications and started off a chain reaction.'' or as yerran naidu phrased it,''if the bjp's intentions are followed by matching actions, then we would have had to review the situation.'' but though their patience has not run out, and the bjp has more to fear from the saffron brotherhood than from its allies, the recent assembly elections, combined with the events in ayodhya, have triggered off a qualitative difference in the relationship: the bjp's abysmal performance has made it look increasingly like a loser. as trinamul congress sources said, ''we would like to be back in the government, but the question is: are we boarding a sinking ship?'' and this concern has sparked off some behind-the-scenes activity: the recent ayodhya crisis saw the jd-u, the tc, the national conference, the dravida munnetra kazhagham and the indian national lok dal all getting in touch with andhra pradesh chief minister n chandrababu naidu; a meeting is likely after the assembly session concludes in hyderabad.

""later, he also got involved in gambling and was running a club in godhra along with husain dhantiya, another accused in this case,"" said a police officer. bilal and the rest of the accused have been booked under poto and for murder. sources said that it was at this club that all the accused used to get together. the entire operation was supervised by dig (ats) vipul vijoy singh. others involved in the operation were dy sp (ats) abhay chudasama and godhra town police inspector kandarp trivedi. meanwhile, the gujarat government is learnt to have suspended a senior clerk in the irrigation department, inayat abdul sattar, for his alleged ''involvement'' in the godhra massacre, said sources. sattar, a senior clerk with the panam dam division, was taken into custody earlier along with 26 others. earlier, state police had sent teams to mumbai, madhya pradesh and chhota udepur to arrest bilal, whose main offence in this case, is of having stopped fire-fighters from reaching the scene of crime which could have saved many lives, said a senior police official. bilal will be handed over to cid (crime, railways), which is investigating the train carnage. in all, 51 persons were arrested in this case, said railway police sources. interestingly, the police has tracked down a similar attack on kar sevaks in bharuch district in 1992 when they were returning by dehradun express from ayodhya after the demolition of ''babri masjid'' and were attacked in a similar manner at palej, sources said. but there were no casualties then. sources said the case-file of the attack on the train carrying kar sevaks at palej in 1992 is to be submitted to the state government for reference and analysis from the angle of security, intelligence and investigation.",0,1,1,0,0

gandhinagar: in a controversial statement that would raise many an eyebrow among the state''s farmers'' associations, especially the bharatiya kisan sangh - a sangh parivar outfit - the state government made it clear on saturday that all new electricity connections in the farm sector will be metered. ""we cannot do anything about it,"" finance minister nitin patel declared, concluding the general debate on the budget for 2002-03 presented on february 27 in the state assembly. ""this is the direction of the gujarat electricity regulatory commission (gerc). we cannot violate it,"" he added. bjp mlas, in the absence of the opposition congress, asked the finance minister whether he wished to abolish metering or not for new connections being provided. a bjp mla even questioned the logic of the state government of giving metered electricity to new connections provided by the gujarat electricity board, 10 years after one was in a queue. nitin merely said, ""i will consult the matter with energy minister kaushik patel."" congress mlas continued their boycott of the assembly on saturday in protest against the suspension of their leader naresh raval for three days. at the same time, he sought to assuage the bjp mlas'' feeling by saying the old unmetered connections will not be touched. ""no proposal is under consideration to meter the electricity provided to the farmers on horse power basis"", he said, adding, ""we will continue to provide subsidy to the geb for giving subsidised power on horse power basis, as before"". currently, the state provides rs 1,300 crore budgeted subsidy to the geb, of which rs 1,100 crore is as compensation to cheap power to the farm sector. currently, there are in all nearly 70,000 metered connections in the state, 65,000 of them having been given after the gerc order two years back. the metered electricity is being provided at the rate of 50 paise per unit, plus electricity duty. as for the non-metered connections, charges are based on the horse power strength of the motor put up to pump out water from the underground. per unit charge of such connections comes to approximately 16 paise. nearly 49 per cent of geb electricity is used up by the farm sector, mainly in the north gujarat region. nitin''s statement acquires significance against the backdrop of the state government''s intention to come up with the electricity reforms bill for discussion in the current assembly session. the bill makes stage-by-stage conversion into metered connection compulsory, a precondition for the 350 million dollar asian development bank loan. already, the state has asked the gerc to review the latter''s earlier judgment to meter all connections within three years. it wants gerc to extend the period to five years. during his intervention, nitin denied that the recent communal riots would adversely affect the state''s economy. ""despite the massive earthquake, we were able to overcome the effect it had on the economy within four months. we are quite capable of dealing with disasters. some people say that gujarat has been pushed back by 20 years. those who make such statements as also those who hear them are mad. we are studying the situation. the industry would be back on the rails soon,"" he pointed out.",0,0,0,0,0

1107,1133,"ahmedabad: last year, there was a different reason for not celebrating holi in gujarat. people generally remained indoor mourning the earthquake victims of the january 26 disaster. the festival on friday could be quite a damp affair this time, but it is the tension build-up in the air which is palpable. friday's holi has got the state on its nerves' edge. this year dhuleti is going to be a festival of different colours for gujarat — there will be the army's green battle fatigues, bright blue of the raf and the khaki of the other uniformed personnel, punctuating the lanes and the by-lanes leaving little chance for people to play as freely as they used to. the tension led to a bout of panic buying of essential commodities across the state on thursday evening, with residents fearing a fresh bout of violence, a month after the riots first began. with thousands of inflammatory leaflets threatening bloodshed on friday in circulation and rumours flying thick and fast, the state home department has decided to extend the curfew to more areas of the state. the ahmedabad police have strictly banned pillion-riding in the city. additional commissioner of police (special branch) pramod kumar said that male pillion riders would not be allowed on the road on friday. the ban on playing with colours, balloons and bulbs would also be in force. indefinite curfew would also be imposed in as many as 16 police station areas of the city, some of them as a precautionary measure. along the same lines, curfew has been clamped on certain areas of visnagar in mehsana where a mixed population resides. in vadodara, the police are likely to impose curfew in six police station areas. but in surat, police officers said imposition of blanket curfew could lead to panic. in rural vadodara, an army column was dispatched to the tribal-dominated bodeli region where the festivities are traditionally quite robust. while no extra reinforcements have been called for, the army and the bsf will patrol ahmedabad continuously on friday. on thursday, the army conducted a flag march in sarkhej where trouble broke out following incidents of arson. meanwhile, governor sunder singh bhandari has appealed to the people to create an atmosphere of mutual trust in society by celebrating the festival of holi-dhuleti with peace and simplicity. related stories

mumbai: chief minister vilasrao deshmukh, on friday assured the legislative assembly that mumbaiâ€™s water supply would not be severed as had been threatened by the state irrigation department in a notice on thursday to the brihanmumbai municipal corporation (bmc). â€œno stringent action would be taken. the matter will be resolved through mutual discussion,â€™â€™ mr deshmukh said, while replying to a debate during zero hour. mr deshmukh described the irrigation departmentâ€™s notice to the bmc as a â€œroutineâ€™â€™ matter. the irrigation department was obviously acting upon stern instructions from the finance department that the recovery of arrears should be expedited to meet the march 31 deadline, the chief minister said. several mumbai mlas were angry about the notice. earlier, moving a notice seeking the adjournment of the assembly in view of the â€œgravityâ€™â€™ of the matter, leader of the opposition narayan rane said, â€œthere was no need for the irrigation department to send a notice to the bmc. the civic officials could have been called for discussionâ€™â€™. mr rane reminded the assembly that the state government too owed rs 450 crore to the bmc. an agitated mr rane accused the congress-led democratic front of threatening to penalise the bmc as it was controlled by the shiv sena-bjp alliance. it had won the civic polls held last month. dismissing the charge, mr deshmukh said that he did not wish to politicise the issue. the cm, however, took objection to a letter to him from the leader of the bmc, prabhakar shinde, on the entire controversy. â€œfirstly, it is the mayor who writes to the chief minister and not the leader of the bmc house. secondly, the language of the letter was objectionable,â€™â€™ mr deshmukh said. â€œyou will have to train your corporators. you can hold a workshop to educate them,â€™â€™ the cm told mr rane. earlier, the sena-bjp mlas staged a walk-out, demanding the suspension of the superintendent of police of buldhana district. the walk-out came at the fag end of the question hour. pointing out that as many as eight cases of communal violence had rocked the district during the last year, bjp leader gopinath munde accused the minister of state for home manikrao thakre of â€œshieldingâ€™â€™ the sp. sensing the belligerent mood of the sena-bjp mlas, speaker arunlal gujarathi permitted mr munde to touch upon â€œone single crucial factâ€™â€™ of the matter even after question hour was over. raising a point of propriety, the chief minister said that the house should proceed with the dayâ€™s agenda as question hour had been wrapped up. mr munde, backed by sena-bjp mlas who had marched into the â€˜wellâ€™ of the house, wanted to know from mr thakre if buldhana district had been rocked by eight cases of communal clashes in the last one year. mr thakre, however, chose to keep mum. the speaker finally went ahead with the agenda, assuring mr munde that he would allow a detailed debate on the issue by way of an adjournment motion.",0,0,0,0,0

anandpur sahib: the hola mohalla eve here witnessed a riot of colours, mostly black, that political parties splashed on one another even as thousands of devotees visiting the historical gurdwara watched it happen with gay abandon. in a veritable show of strength the congress exhibited its political prowess in a manner that reduced the shiromani akali dal to a seemingly marginal player with the tohra and the mann factions of the akali dal also pitching in their tents. harping on his by-now-favourite topic of corruption during the sad-bjp rule, chief minister amarinder singh said the government would soon recommend appropriate action against punjab public service commission chairman ravi inder paul sidhu to ensure that he was removed from the office after having allegedly found receiving a bribe of rs 5 lakh. even as sidhu has been behind the bars, the government, after seeking legal opinion, proposed to make interim arrangements to ensure smooth running of the ppsc. the chief minister said for the last six months he had been crying hoarse that the ppsc was reeking with corruption. but the then chief minister prakash singh badal turned deaf ear to it, giving indications as if he was in nexus with the chairman. how else badal allowed rampant corruption to prevail in the ppsc? amarinder asked. he said his government was determined to combat corruption without, however, indulging in witchhunting and vendetta. the chief minister reiterated his unstinted support to all ssps to root out corruption. in spite of severe econimic crisis that had gripped the state, his government was committed to development, he added. the chief minister announced that all border villages would start receiving round-the-clock electricity supply. he said a rs 176-crore package had been prepared for the development works in border villages even as farmers whose land was taken over by the defence personnel recently, would be given adequate compensation. amarinder said he had held consultations with the defence minister george fernandes on this issue. the shiromani akali dal conference was conspicuous by the absence of badal. even as the attendance at the sad conference was a telling sign of the party presently got out of power, senior leaders like sukhdev singh dhindsa, capt kanwaljit singh, jagir kaur and sgpc president kirpal singh badungar remained undeterred and held the fort. the conference took exception to the congress governmentâ€™s alleged policy of giving secondary treatment to punjabi language during the recent vidhan sabha session, and also warned against disconnecting 24-hour power supply to this holy city. the conference proposed two resolutions on the count and threatened to launch agitations if the government did not revise its policy on these issues. speaking at the conference, former sgpc president gurcharan singh tohra spared the congress but chose to focus his attack on the centre and the badal faction. he expressed concern over the recent riots in gujarat and the resolution adopted by the rss and said that the centre was deliberately creating insecurity among minorities. the dal khalsa, the aissf (gill) and the aiyad joined tohra in his protest.they announced to present memorandum to the governor in chandigarh on april 5 against the promulgation of the pota.",0,0,0,0,0

lucknow: the controversies about the two shilas refuse to die down. with each passing day, a new one erupts and the carved stones have now become thorns in the flesh of the district administration. on thursday, a group of influential anti-vhp saints have threatened to fling the stones into the gutter if the district administration did not remove them from dasrath mahal by friday. the mahant of dasrath mahal and other sadhus have threatened indefinite fast also. on the fresh controversy, the commissioner dr a.k. gupta said; â€œthe district administration had sent a letter to the ayodhya cell head and osd at pmo shatrughan singh seeking his direction where to keep the two shilas.â€� but the district administration is in a bind as no reply has yet landed. â€œwe are awaiting a reply and would take a decision accordingly,â€� he said. while the district administration is still looking for answers to, â€œwhose shilas are they anyway?â€� the threat by a group of influential anti-vhp mahants has added to their woes. the chief trustee, ramalaya trust mahant jugal kishore shastri has this to say; â€œwe would go to the place where these shilas are kept and break open the lock. if police tried to stop us and arrest that would invite more trouble for the district administrationâ€�. â€œif the two shilas are not removed by friday we would throw them in the gutter,â€� threatened the dasrath mahal head, swami devendra prasadacharya. anti-vhp seers and saints are annoyed with the district administration for keeping the two shilas at dasrath mahal, a part of bara sthan without their permission and consent. the controversy arose when, on his return from chattisgrah, mahant prasadacharya, fired the district administration for keeping the two shilas at his place on march 15 without obtaining any permission from him. the anti-vhp seers and saints alleged that it was done under a well-planned vhp strategy with an aim to grab their properties. â€œthey (vhp and rjn) have done so in the past,â€� fumed mahant prasadacharya. â€œthe two shilas have been consecrated by those who are thoroughly corrupt,â€� charged mahant jugal kishore shashtri.

moga: taking advantage of the panic situation among cotton growers in punjab due to decline in productivity in the past two years, few private companies have resorted to selling seeds of â€œunrecommendedâ€� hybrid variety, cotton experts said. experts from punjab agricultural university, ludhiana, said that even though cultivation of bt cotton in india is awaiting union governmentâ€™s nod, illegally grown bt cotton in gujarat has attracted farmers of northern states to go in for the cultivation of such seeds. this has prompted some traders in punjab to bring in large quantities of f2 seeds under the name of bt cotton from gujarat, for its sale in the state, they added. according to experts, the sowing of f2 seeds is of little use.â€œthe sowing of such f2 seeds even of bt based hybrids by the farmers will definitely cause a further setback to the cotton crop in the stateâ€�, they added. about bt cottonâ€™s resistance to american bollworm, experts say that experiments conducted on bt cotton had shown that it was not possible to completely eliminate the attack of american bollworm by growing bt cotton. â€œbut it is certainly capable of reducing the pesticide load against the pest to a large extent â€œ, they said. the experts have cautioned the cotton growers to purchase the seeds only from authorised companies and that too after the government allows use of bt cotton.",0,0,0,0,0

1121,869,"ahmedabad: those talking about normalcy returning to gujarat perhaps have in mind the crowds that throng the state''s first mcdonald''s outlet here since it opened last thursday. in these five days, about 30,000 visited the restaurant â€” an unbelievable response in these troubled times. but big mac''s success is giving a false sense of normalcy in a city that has lost 300 lives so far. in fact, a full one month after the february 27 godhra attack, gujarat is still feeling the heat from the burnt down s-6 compartment of sabarmati express. the first week of frenzy had just died down when the march 15 ram shila pujan fuelled a fresh bout of violence which has so far taken 30 more lives. with holi''s potential for mischief later this week, none of the nearly 100,000 refugees at the relief camps is willing to go back to their homes. most of them actually have no homes to go back to, and even if they do, the feeling of fear is so overwhelming that they are willing to live in the filthy camps rather than risk attacks. just consider the statistics of the month-long nightmare. the official death toll stands at 783. nearly 97,998 people are living in 101 relief camps. the government has declared different packages, including that of providing rs 5,000 to rs 50,000 as compensation to those whose houses have been gutted, but the claimants don''t know where to build their houses. police say 125 persons have died in police firing. they fired 6,500 rounds, lobbed 8,300 teargas shells and arrested a staggering 10,000 people. impressive figures, but nobody is impressed. not the all-party mps'' delegation or the national commission for minorities or even the national human rights commission. the impact of violence is written around not only the relief camps but also the nearly 30 towns and cities of gujarat which are still under curfew as the police, facing the music for their initial sluggishness, are not taking any chances in the build-up to holi. the carnages of the first three days, or 72 hours as chief minister narendra modi likes to put it, have given way to a low-intensity but sustained warfare where students going to examination halls have been stabbed, nurses going to hospital for the night-shift have been attacked with acid bombs, individuals having married outside the community have been hunted down and killed and people being escorted to safety by the police have been lynched. ask modi when all this would end and he finds a rather strange synchronisation between the mps and the mobs when he says that the violence would come to an end when the lok sabha session ends. the human toll and the shattered psyche apart, it is the financial punch of the riots that is beginning to tell. cii and gcci estimates of losses in this one month are rs 2,000 crore, something that a state already reeling under the impact of the earthquake just could not afford. the earthquake at least brought people together.... related storiesÂ violence continues, vajpayee summons modiÂ even nurses not being spared by rioters Â non-gujarati muslim officers await an exit

himmatnagar: police in the urban areas of gujarat have drawn most of the flak so far owing to their being in constant media glare; but out in the countryside, where scores were killed, their failure to secure lives, besides their putting obstacles in the legal process of bring the guilty to book, seems to have gone largely unnoticed. the role of the police in sabarkantha district, as a case in point, has only recently become the subject of debate, from the lok sabha to the police bhavan in gandhinagar. the main allegation against the sabarkantha police is that they did not do enough to protect the innocent and were now preventing the registration of firs against the individuals who led the mobs. in fact, nearly 137 petitioners from the district had to move gujarat high court to have their voices heard. they claimed that the police had not recorded their individual firs. says congress mp from sabarkantha madhusudhan mistry, who raised the matter in the lok sabha, ""the role of the district police has been very dubious, the police are accepting firs which refer to a mob and not those where individuals leading the mob have been named."" the total loss to private business establishments in himmatnagar town is said to be as high as rs 50 crore, with most of the damage being done during curfew and often in the presence of the police. it is the role of district superintendent of police nitiraj solanki that has come into question as stray incidents of violence keep the situation on the boil even today. ""the last of the few remaining shops of the minorities within the town were torched during curfew in the last three days when no one was supposed to be out on the streets,"" says khadim lalpuria who runs the biggest relief camp for the minority community at mehtapura on the outskirts of the town. ""we have communicated our desire to give an award to solanki for his services against us,"" he adds in a sarcastic vein. ""people came in tractors from the neighbouring villages, heavily armed, and torched and looted shops in the commercial complexes along the national higway, cutting through the heart of the city... and all this took place amid the presence of the police personnel who did not do anything to control the mobs,"" alleged lalpuria. in fact, since march 20 when curfew was reimposed, several shops belonging to the minorities which were still untouched were also torched along with a dargah at mehtapura, barely 200 metres from the residence of the district collector. nitiraj solanki was not available for comment, but senior officials in the state police headquarters admitted that ""solanki has got all mixed up."" locals cannot but be apprehensive. they first saw the police look the other way when their establishments and houses were set on fire. now, the police is trying its best not to let the victims lift the veil of anonymity on the mobs. take the instance of baba harsulia of raj motors, who did manage to take down the registration number and identify three of the six people who were part of the 500-strong mob that torched his sprawling 11,000 sq-ft tractor showroom on the outskirts of the city. baba mentioned the details in a written complaint, but the road to justice seems strewn with roadblocks. ""first the police tried to convince us that it would be in our best interest if the police remained the complainant. when we insisted, the local police dissuaded us, saying technical problems could crop up if the complaint was duplicated in the fir filed by the police with one given by the victim himself. but all these are ways to block filing of the individual complaint where we have been able to identify a few who were part of the mob,"" says harsulia. shabbirbhai aglodia of jahirpura was similarly stone-walled when he went to the jadar police station to file a complaint about his house being burnt down.

mumbai: arif manwa, who has been planting bt cotton for about two years, is looking at a farm ravaged by pests. his tragedy is echoed by several of his neighbours, all of them small cotton farmers who had planted the `wonder seeds'' of bt cotton.

these genetically modified (gm) seeds were expected to kill the dreaded bollworm, but arif''s farm reveals that the pests in his area have become resistant to the bt toxin. obviously, something has gone wrong with the bt experiment.

although arif''s story is unfolding in sulawesi, indonesia, it holds greatÂ� salience for india. india''s genetic engineering approval committee (geac) is meeting today to decide whether commercial cultivation of bt-cotton should be allowed in the country.

many farmers and agrobiotech companies eagerly await what is by most accounts going to be a heads up to bt-cotton cultivators. however, many environmentalists and scientists fear that legalising bt-cotton cultivation could herald a new environmental and economic quandary for the country.

scientists explain that the pest-resistant trait of bt-cotton is unlikely to hold up in india because the country''s agricultural conditions are dramatically different from conditions in north america, where bt-cotton was originally developed. they say that to gauge the stark contrast between indian and american conditions, one should consider the instructions issued by the united states environment protection agency for bt-cotton cultivation. ``at least five acres of non-bt cotton should be planted for every 95 acres of bt-cotton. the size of this five-acre `refuge'' (which is a buffer zone where bollworms can feed) should be at least 150 feet wide.''''

``leave aside refuges, even many of our fields are not 150 feet wide. our tiny land holdings are separated not by five acres of buffer zones but more often by small gutters. given the indian cheek-by-jowl agricultural conditions and the country''s heavy pest load, a rapid breakdown of resistance __ as seen in indonesia __ is inevitable,'''' says suman sahai, founder of gene campaign, a non-governmental environmental movement.

the breakdown of bt-cotton''s pest resistance will mean that farmers will have to start using pesticides again. this has already begun in australia, where the transgenic and insect management strategy committee of the australian cotton growers research association has advised its farmers to spray additional insecticide since ``the bt is failing to control the target pest it was introduced for''''.

more importantly, a widely used, ecofriendly pesticide __ the bt bacteria __will no more be available for use on cotton or on other crops.

monsanto, the multinational company which developed bt-cotton, has countered that to deal with the resistance problem, it is now working on a cotton plant which will have two toxin-producing genes. currently, bt-cotton has one toxin-producing gene from a soil-borne bacterium, bacillus thuringiensis.

environmentalists wryly respond that this strategy of producing gm plants with an increasing number of toxin-producing genes is similar to the past ruinous strategy which forced farmers to use more and more toxic pesticides. ``when fourth generation pesticides were introduced in india, there was great excitement __ not unlike the excitement welcoming bt-cotton. for the first two-three years, the pesticides killed everything, including bollworms. butÂ� soon, insects developed resistance, leading to even more poisonous sprays, and then failed harvests and mounting debts for farmers,'''' recounts a senior official in the ministry of environment and forests, who wished to remain anonymous. by some accounts, a very large number of cotton farmers across the country have committed suicide in the last two decades. their debts and despair have been triggered at least partly by the vicious chemical cycleÂ� which backfired on them.

will the seeming reprieve offered by bt-cotton end up as similarlyÂ� short-lived manna? vandana shiva, a leading environmentalist, admits that this is a very real danger, especially since gm crops are being brought into india at a time when the vast majority __ farmers, journalists, government, and scientists __ have not studied the implications of gm technology. ``india''s biosafety ignorance makes it gullible to corporate propaganda, and doesn''t allow us to act on our rights and responsibilities,'''' she says.

ironically, the farmers who have been badly hit by the chemical trap of pesticides are the ones most loudly clamouring for bt-cotton. they are joined by politicians, be it the chief minister of punjab or the agriculture minister of gujarat, economists, and members of the media in criticising the regulatory body, the geac in the ministry of environment and forests, for insisting on field trials to ascertain the suitability of bt-cotton in indian conditions.

these critics bemoan that india''s agricultural productivity and globalÂ� competitiveness are being held back. they point to china and how its bt-cotton is racing ahead in export markets without any apparent environmental or social costs.

ms shiva deflates the myth of china''s bt-cotton success by pointing out that the country is exporting more cotton because previously closed markets are liberalising, and not because of bt technology. ``commentators are confusing the consequences of trade with technology,'''' she says.

moreover, little biosafety or environmental data has emerged from china, adds ms sahai. according to her, the absence of data does not mean that there has been no environmental damage, but that there are no regulatory and monitoring processes in place. ``there are many environmental catastrophes in china, but the data might never be collected and will definitely not be allowed to leave the country easily,'''' she says. ``after all, china is not only the country of export successes but also of the cultural revolution and the great leap forward in which several millions of people were killed and the world didn''t know about this until decades later.''''

experts further assert that china is arguably the worst political template for india. ``political and technological questioning is not easily allowed there, especially if these go against policies of the party high command. expecting india to adhere to a similarly non-transparent dictatorial system is not only foolhardy, it is dangerous for our people,'''' asserts the bureaucrat from theÂ� ministry of environment and forests.

``in no democratic country have gm crops been introduced in a hurry. only countries like china have hurriedly heralded them in,'''' affirms ms shiva. in this context, it is worth noting that the united states took about a decade before allowing large-scale gm cultivation. some countries in europe have outright banned gm crops. in other countries such as britain, where there isÂ� no commercial gm cultivation, gm food has been one of the most contentious topics of public debate in the last decade.

as the debate in india on the pros and cons of gm crops builds up, few are calling for an outright ban on all gm crops and gm research. even critics of bt-cotton acknowledge that there are significant advantages to be reaped from this new technology __ be it in developing drought-resistant grains or higher yield pulses. ``it is more a question of whether we are going to be strong-armed into using gm crops in a hurry through a combination of aggressive multinational promotion and domestic gullibility and corruption, or whether we will adopt this technology selectively, under proper regulation, at our own pace, and on our own terms,'''' sums up ms sahai.",0,0,0,0,0

""the procession of the sants would begin around 2.15 pm. i reckon they would take about 20-25 minutes to reach the designated spot to hand over the shila,"" he explained. the designated place for the shila daan at ramkot is about 3 kilometers away from the karsevakpuram, where mahant paramhans is staying. gupta, government sources clarified, would be receiving the shila as the government receiver of the acquired land, and not as the faizabad collector. when asked about the ground situation in ayodhya, gupta said with the paramhans accepting his proposal on handing over the shila, the crisis may have been defused for the time being. ""but, that does not mean that we will relax the security bandobast,"" he explained. an estimated 15,000 security personnel are based in ayodhya to counter any untoward incidents. when asked about his response to the opposition attacking the centre on the issue of a government official accepting the shila from the sants, gupta said he would not like to answer to this question. he also said he was not aware of any minority community organisation protesting against the government decision to appoint him as the receiver of the shila. even though the administration was now geared up to accept the sacred shila, there was still some confusion on what the government would do with it.

lucknow: who will foot the bill if the high court appoints a commission for expeditious hearing of ayodhya cases? though up government has given its consent to the three-judge bench that it would abide by the court directive, on its own, the state may not be able to bear the expenses with its coffers all empty. a piquant situation arose when the bench asked the state government whether or not it was ready to bear the burden if a commission was set up. during lunch hour, additional solicitor general r n trivedi called up senior up officials in this connection. initially the state governmentâ€™s response was negative, it is understood. later, instructions were passed on to the state law department to file a written reply that the state government would bear the cost. the reply was submitted by additional advocate general ramesh kumar singh . keeping the stateâ€™s finacial constraints in mind, it is learnt, an understanding was reached with the centre that if the state government failed to bear the burden, the centre would chip in. the court had already appointed three commissions in the past for recording evidence of witnesses. the first one was that of additional district judge, faizabad, who had recorded evidence of ram janambhoomi nyas chairman mahant ramchandra das paramhans. the second was headed by narendra srivastava, osd allahabad high court while the third one was that of additional district judge, noida ,which was appointed to record statement of dr s p gupta, a witness. for each witness, there would be a separate one-man commission (called commissioner). the commissionâ€™s economics, however, makes a big hole in stateâ€™s pocket. a huge sum is spent on ta/da/staff/vehicle/accommodation/fare and other paraphernalia of the commission. the state also bears expenses incurred on counsels who accompany the commission to cross-examine the witness. the expenses increase manifold as it takes about 10 to 15 days to record evidence. so far, evidence of only one witness has been recorded by the commission from hindu side (mahant das) while evidence of two otherâ€” devki nandan and dr s p guptaâ€” are being recorded. from muslim side, 24 witnesses have so far appeared and cross-examination of 25th is on. about 25 witnesses from hindu side and 4 or 5 from muslim side are yet to appear before the ayodhya court (or commission if appointed). the expenses on separate commission for each witness may prove to be a big drain on the state exchequer.",0,0,0,0,0

ahmedabad: supercop julio ribeiro has been livid of late. as someone who was shifted from mumbai to ahmedabad as police commissioner at the request of the gujarat government to quell the 1985 riots, he says he is ashamed at the way the police have conducted themselves during the recent violence that wracked the state. ""policemen have become eunuchs today,"" he proclaims. speaking to tnn from mumbai, ribeiro said policemen have only themselves to blame for ""turning eunuchs"". ""what the police force needs today are leaders who can lead from the front and show that they mean business; what we have today are officers who lobby with politicians to get themselves posted as commissioners and director-generals and they have to pay back the politicians for these favours,"" he said. ribeiro says in moments of crisis, the entire police force looks at its leaders for directions. ""if at that moment, the police force thinks their boss is looking to the mantralaya for directions, you have had it."" in the ''85 riots, when ribeiro was called in after the local police failed to contain the riots for weeks together, ribeiro arrested five congress leaders under the national security act despite the fact that gujarat then was a congress-ruled state. ""almost immediately, everybody could see that i meant business and the entire force could sense that i was in charge of the situation,"" he recalls. no officer under him, he said, dared not to carry out his duties because each one of them was accountable only to the law, not to the political party in power. ribeiro says he finds the excuse given by the police in gujarat, that they were unable to check the riots because they were outnumbered by the mobs, rather specious. ""five armed policemen are enough to control a mob of 5,000, but the policemen should show, through their body language, that they are determined; if they take position and train their guns at the people, the mobs can easily sense trouble and back off."" besides, he says, even if the police were outnumbered , it was their job to fire at the mobs. ""if policemen die in the process, well that''s it, that is what they are trained for, it is their job."" he adds that he does not believe the remark of a senior ahmedabad police official that the policemen were part of society and could not remain isolated from all its influences. ""this is nonsense, what are policemen trained for then...they are trained to maintain law and order at all costs and remain free and fair under all circumstances; when they wear a uniform, they should be loyal to only the uniform, nothing else."" if there are any doubts on this count, he says, the police force should look to the army and take inspiration from it. ribeiro said the riots in gujarat, beginning with the godhra incident, had a ""frightening ring to them"". the frightening aspect was that there was a veneer of nationalism being given to it. ""this is not patriotism or nationalism; all that you are doing is to weaken the fabric of the nation and that can be very dangerous."". the problem, as he sees it, cannot be solved only through policing methods. it is in this connection that he has launched projects in the slums of mumbai to bring communities together and make them understand that the leaders who instigate them never get caught. it is only the innocent who suffer and get killed. wanted: another ribeiro! gujarat congress president amarsinh choudhary was the chief minister in ''85 when he recommended to the centre that they send a senior and independent officer to contain the riots in ahmedabad. in came ribeiro and the riots abated in a couple of days. choudhary says ribeiro was effective because he was ""fiercely independent and nobody could influence him"". what we need today is another ribeiro, says choudhary, because the police force is dancing to the tunes of the ruling bjp and badly let the people down.

kolkata: the culprits involved in the attack on the train at godhra in gujarat did not cross over to bangladesh through indo-bangla border in west bengal, chief minister buddhadeb bhattacharjee told the state assembly on thursday. bhattacharjee made the statement to a supplementary raised by the leader of the opposition pankaj banerjee, who belongs to the trinamool congress. the chief minister, however, admitted that the indo-bangla border was being used by terrorist outfits and smugglers and this was nothing new. it was not possible for the state government alone to prevent north bengal being used by the insurgents as free corridor until and unless the borders were being protected properly by the bsf personnel, he said. the chief minister also said that a total of 30 persons have been arrested over the past two years in the state on charges of being operating as isi agents. the information, in reply to a question by cpi legislator purnendu sengupta, was to have been orally given to the assembly during question hour on thursday. however, the question did not come up for discussion due to lack of time. bhattacharjee in his reply stated that anti-terrorist cells were operating at the state intelligence bureau as well as the state criminal investigation department. border vigil has been strengthened. hotels, guest houses and vital installations are being closely watched, the chief minister said. earlier, replying to a question by trinamul congress mla jyotipriya mullick, the chief minister said that the state government was creating new police stations in the border areas to tackle the problem of terrorist elements infiltrating into india through the porous borders. new police outposts have recently been created at purnea crossing under karandighi police station of north dinajpur and at bulbulchandi under habibpur police station of malda district. new stations have been opened and are more being planned in darjeeling, siliguri jalpaiguri and cooch behar. however, we cannot open more than seven or eight police stations a year due to financial constraints, bhattacharjee said. most of the new police stations that have come up in recent years are in the border areas. guarding the borders is essentially the responsibility of the centre. however, only 20 battalions of the border security force as against the sanctioned strength of 34 battalions are stationed here, which leaves a vast area unguarded, the chief minister said. the union home ministry has been requested to give more central forces. i have personally talked to lk advani twice over the issue, he said. the main issue over guarding the borders is creation of border roads and fencing. we have completed around 70 per cent of the border roads. but fencing is far from complete, the chief minister said.

gandhinagar: amid slogan shouting by opposition mlas calling for narendra modi''s resignation, the congress on thursday sharply critised the gujarat government for the intelligence failure in predicting either the godhra train massacre or the communal genocide that followed thereafter. while congress legislature party leader naresh raval asked why the forces that were supposed to be linked with the isi were at all allowed to flourish in godhra, congress chief whip siddharth patel wanted to know why were the kar sevaks returning from ayodhya on february 27 not provided with any police protection. patel asked ""i want to know from the state government what were the intelligence officials were doing on that fateful day? was there any prior information of what was to happen? if yes, then why preventive steps were not taken? the way the train was burnt and the manner in which the government allowed all this to happen leads one to suspect that the officialdom messed up things very badly somewhere."" the strong questions come at a time when congress has begun making allegations that the state intelligence officials were all busy at rajkot where chief minister narendra modi had just fought his assembly bypoll. patel, son of former chief minister chimanbhai patel, also wanted to know as to why the officialdom failed to predict what was in store even when the vhp gave a bandh call for february 28. referring to minister of state for revenue haren pandya''s speech earlier, patel said, ""it seems, the state government was fully aware of what would happen as a consequence to the bandh call. yet, it did not act in time. as a result, gujarat''s image has suffered a serious setback in the world."" pandya had said, speaking in the debate, ""the events such as cross-border terrorism, attacks on the hindus in kashmir, the isi activities in mosques and madrasas, the attack on parliament in delhi had adversely impacted upon the gujarati hindu psyche. it exploded after godhra."" during his statement, pandya revealed that as many as 85,155 people lived in 91 relief camps in gujarat run all over gujarat. minister of state for home gordhan zadaphia added that post-godhra, 668 persons had died in communal violence, out of which 100 were to police firing. the two ministers, during their intervention, did not say whether there was any prior information of godhra or the communal flare-up that followed. zadaphia confined his statement to when the army was called and how the riot was controlled within 72 hours. sharply criticising the bjp for playing the hindu card, raval said, ""the congress is not a party of one community. its voters include hindus, muslims, sikhs, others. we believe in brotherhood among all the people. the electoral politics that the bjp has begun to play makes one suspect that there is something fishy. the bjp must remember hindus have always been our voters. they will support us in future also."" he added, ""i am worried about the future of gujarat because after these riots investments will suffer."" the assembly, which began session at 8.30 am, was twice adjourned before the debate could begin as 50-odd congress mlas and independents shouted slogans demanding the cm''s resignation in the wake of the state government''s alleged failure. there was also furore from bjp benches when a congress mla alleged the cm had said he would hang himself if the riots were not controlled within 72 hours. the cm explained, he had actually said, ""if controlling riots within 72 hours was a crime, i should be hanged"".

hyderabad: the cpm has decided to intensify its efforts to form a third front as an alternative to the congress and the bjp at the national level for filling up what it called the political vaccum in the country. several top leaders of the cpm who participated in the inaugural session of the partyâ€™s 17th national congress which commenced here on tuesday, stressed the need for the party â€œto play a pro-active role in forming the third front immediately in the light of the rapid decline of the bjp.â€� reiterating the partyâ€™s resolve to provide a â€œdemocratic alternativeâ€� to the country, cpm general secretary harkishan singh surjeet in his inaugural address, however, said that the party could not wait any further as there was an urgent need to forge an alternative. â€œthe peopleâ€™s anger against the bjp is rising and this was witnessed in the uttar pradesh assembly elections. the people realised that the bjp wants a government that will give a free hand for experimenting policies of globalisation and liberalisation,â€� he said. he said that though the issue of isolation of the bjp was discussed in the earlier meetings of the party, no concrete results emerged from that. even the earlier fronts formed by the party with the help of its allies could not sustain as there was no commonality of objectives among the allies. â€œunlike the earlier occasions, the peopleâ€™s democratic front this time will have a working class leadership,â€� he said. in his 30-minute address, surjeet also touched upon various national and international issues as well as the threat to the national unity by the â€œcommunal policies of the nda government at the centre.â€� former west bengal chief minister jyoti basu said that the recent heightening of tension on ayodhya issue and the communal killings in gujarat were â€œa pointer to the path which the rightist forces led by the bjp intend to take the country. â€œthe massive killings in gujarat have only forced some of the nda allies to make secular noises only to keep their base intact,â€� basu added. on the election side, he said that the bjp had lost 14 out of the 18 elections in the last three years. cpi general secretary ab bardhan, who is a special invitee to the congress, said in his address that the ayodhya turmoil showed the lengths to which the bjp can go in order to push its agenda and hold on to power. â€œthe communal forces are on rampage with the connivance of the bjp governments at the centre and in states,â€� he said adding there was a need for the leftist forces to unite and combat the threat to the nation from the bjp.",0,0,0,0,0

lucknow: former chief minister and bjp leader rajnath singh has urged the religious leaders of muslim, christian and other communities to come forward and prevent ram janmabhoomi nyas (rjn) chief from ending his life. expressing deep concern over the threat given by the saint that he would end his life if he is not allowed to perform religious rites at ayodhya on friday, singh said he was not only the rjn chief, but was a great 'dharmacharya' (religious leader) worshipped by hindus. he said he was deeply hurt by this announcement made by paramhans and urged him to withdraw this decision since his guidance was needed by the hindu society for many years to come. talking to mediapersons at a hurriedly called press conference here on thursday, singh lamented that the court had not been able to decide a title suit pending before it since 1949, even after fifty years. he said that had it not been delayed so much, the situation would not have taken such a critical turn. he said in a democratic set up, it was the duty of every wing, including judiciary, legislature and executive, to take speedy decisions at least on such sensitive issues. he said that even after the 1992 episode, the court had not taken any step to speed up the disposal of the case. he welcomed the central government's action requesting the court to take steps for speedy disposal of this case. singh said those who criticised attorney general soli sorabjee for his submission before the supreme court regarding the puja perhaps did not realise the gravity of the situation. he said it was only an attempt to avert any unpleasant situation. replying to a question regarding the samajwadi party's (sp) decision to send its workers to ayodhya, singh said sp had always attempted to damage national unity. the former chief minister alleged that sp was trying to complicate the situation and fan trouble in ayodhya. quoting an example, he said the sp leaders always tried to disturb communal harmony by creating unruly scenes every year in the parliament on december 6.",0,0,0,0,0

ahmedabad: the gujarat high court observed on monday that it was open for the state government and the gujarat secondary education board to restore the option of alternative exams for the students of class-x and class-xii. while making it clear that the court did not want to interfere in the decision to give an optional exam, a division bench comprising justice rk abhichandani and justice kundan singh rejected a petition filed by prakash jhaveri of new gujarat jagrut vali mandal, seeking direction on this. the court observed that holding of exams at places where there are no disturbances and holding them at some other time at places where there are disturbances does not create any discrepancy. the state has the powers to conduct the exams and has the responsibility to complete it, so the court does not find it necessary to intervene, it said. additional advocate general kb trivedi appeared for the state, while government pleader ad oza appeared for the board. senior advocate yatin oza with advocate harin raval appeared for the petitioners. it was submitted by the government that the it has appointed a committee which is keeping an eye on the overall situation. the collector, who chairs the committee, has all the powers in this regard. besides, the government stated that when the exams have already started, the court''s intervention will adversely affect the students. the petitioner requested the court that the option given earlier to the students by the board has been withdrawn and it should be restored. the option was that the students may choose to appear for the exams on may 6, if not from march 18. the court, however, ordered that whether to offer such an option is open for the state government to decide. it was submitted by the petitioners that there is curfew in the cities of dabhoi, balasinore, bhavnagar and many others. the disturbances are going to increase day by day, it was submitted. thus, there will not be any consistency in the results of the examinations and thus, the actions of the respondents is bad and illegal and deserves to be quashed and set aside. it was submitted that the action of the respondents in holding the examinations from march 18 is contradictory to their own statements and policies. it had been decided by the government itself that the students would be permitted to appear for the examination, which is starting on may 6, in case they have not opted for the current examinations. the petitioners alleged that the decision was taken by the respondents to show that except for ahmedabad and vadodara city, there is peace in whole of gujarat and there are no disturbances. it was submitted that by this decision, the students who are appearing for the examinations in the cities except ahmedabad and vadodara, where there are disturbances and there is curfew, are going to be adversely affected, as they are not able to concentrate on their studies and some of the students would not be able to reach their centre of examination. the government changed its decision to give optional exams, despite the fact that there was no change in the circumstances. communal disturbances prevail all over gujarat and there is curfew in many cities. it would not be possible for the students to appear for the examination and therefore the action of the respondents deserves to be quashed and set aside, it was submitted. it sought directions to postpone the exams and hold them at some other time.",0,0,0,0,0

""after all, the examiners checking the papers written on march 18 onwards would know that they were not examining answersheets of those centres where the examinations were postponed. a bias is likely to set in. i would request education minister anandiben patel to work out a mechanism whereby the students and parents don''t feel that they have become victims of such discrimination,"" amin said.

gandhinagar/ahmedabad: those talking about normalcy returning to gujarat perhaps have in mind the crowds that have been thronging the state''s first mcdonald''s outlet in ahmedabad since it opened last thursday. mcdonald''s india (western region) managing director amit jatia says during the first five days of the restaurant''s opening, which had to be postponed because of the riots, about 30,000 people visited it, evoking an unbelievable response in these troubled times. but the fast food chain''s success paints a false picture of normalcy in a city that has lost nearly 300 lives so far. a month after the senseless attack on the sabarmati express carrying ram sevaks from ayodhya on february 27, gujarat is still feeling the heat coming out of the burnt down s-6 compartment. the first week of frenzy had just died down when the march 15 ''shila pujan'' in ayodhya fuelled a fresh bout of violence, which has so far taken another 30 lives. and now, with holi''s potential for mischief later this week, nobody out of the nearly one lakh refugees at the relief camps is willing to return home. most of them actually have no homes to go back to, and even if they haven''t been burnt down, the fear is so overwhelming that they are willing to slog it out in filthy camps than risk another mob attack. consider the statistics of the month-long nightmare gujarat has lived: the official toll stands at 783 and, with each passing day, is stealthily inching closer to the 800 mark. nearly 97,998 people live in 101 relief camps. the government has declared different packages, including that of providing rs 5,000 to rs 50,000 as compensation to those whose houses have been gutted, but the claimants don''t know where to rebuild their houses. police statistics show 125 people have died in police firing. the police fired 6,500 rounds, exploded 8,300 tear-gas shells and has arrested a staggering 10,000 people. impressive statistics these. but nobody''s impressed, not the all-party mps delegation neither the national commission for minorities nor the national human rights commission. the impact of violence is writ large not only in the city''s relief camps but also in the nearly 30 towns and cities of gujarat, still under curfew, as the police, beaten black and blue because of its initial sluggishness, is not taking any chances in the build-up to holi. the violence in the first three days, or 72 hours as chief minister narendra modi likes to put it, has given way to a low intensity but sustained war where students going to examination halls have been stabbed, nurses going to hospitals on night shifts attacked with acid bombs, individuals having married outside the community have been hunted down and killed and people being escorted to safety by the police lynched. ask the chief minister when all this will end and he finds a rather strange synchronisation between opposition mps and the mobs. the violence will end when the lok sabha session ends, he declared at a recent meeting in rajkot. the toll and the shattered psyche apart, it''s the financial punch that the riots have delivered that''s now beginning to tell. confederation of indian industry and gujarat chambers of commerce and industry estimates show business losses in the last month ranging between rs 2,000 crore and rs 2,250 crore. something, that a state which was already reeling under the impact of the quake just couldn''t afford. but in some ways, many believe the killer quake was, perhaps, better than the riots. at least, it brought people together.",1,1,1,1,1

mumbai: when mumbai was in flames during the post-babri masjid riots of 1992-â€™93, a zone of armed peace existed in the very heart of the furnace. on the noisy dr ambedkar road in byculla, the hanuman mandir and moti masjid, which share a compound wall and a bloody history, kept the peace of the neighbourhood. in that riot-torn winter, while mobs howled and neighbouring nagpada was charred to a cinder, the namaz and aarti here went on undisturbed even as vanloads of policemen kept a tense vigil outside. the police watch was repeated this month on friday the 15th when the ayodhya bomb threatened to explode again, the vhpâ€™s ghantaanad programme hung in the air like a loyalty test of sorts, and the blood of gujarat dripped endlessly on television screens across the country. the â€˜sensitive areasâ€™ of the city were zeroed in on and the byculla mandir-masjid zone registered an alarming high on the sensitivity index. mumbai held its breath and put its faith in the decade-long work of the mohalla committees, which had been particularly active in the locality. when the evening call for prayer went out as usual and night fell without a single stone being thrown or lathi being raised, the neighbourhood knew that it had turned the corner. mohammed ayub inayatullah, who is president of the local mohalla committee and has the standing of an elder in the community, is proud of the fact that journalists â€œfrom out of indiaâ€™â€™ have come to document the peaceful cohabitance of the shrines. â€œthere was a time when the ringing of bells and the aazan competed with each other,â€™â€™ he says, â€œbut that is a thing of the past. during the 1992 riots, i went around telling hindu shopkeepers to open their shops and not be afraid because we were with them. everywhere else there was rioting, here no one was harmed.â€™â€™ at which point one asks the question that begs to be asked, at what price peace? for, the byculla peace, like most cultivated peace efforts, has a bloody benediction. the pujari of the hanuman temple will tell you that the old-timers of bombay refer to the hanuman mandir as danga maruti, given the number of skirmishes it sparked off. the spokesperson of the moti masjid will also vouch for the fact that both parties have been obdurate in the pastâ€”the muslims objecting to the bhajans, the hindus to the azanâ€”but since they are destined to â€œcut time togetherâ€™â€™ they have adopted the policy of peaceful non-interference. there have even been occasions when one has lent the other water at festival time. â€œas a child i remember we used to find it hard to get workmen to come here for any kind of repairs,â€™â€™ says p. p. rahurkar, whose family has owned the hanuman temple for generations. â€œi also remember that during the communal riots of 1946 my father, who was the pujari, was given special police protection. in fact, he wasnâ€™t even allowed to stay on the temple premises because of the threat to his life. he used to be escorted here for the puja and then taken back.â€™â€™ what does it feel like to be the custodians of the only hindu shrine in an otherwise muslim locality? â€œwhenever there is communal trouble elsewhere we get a little worried, especially since we are the only hindus here. but then we have faith in our neighbours. we have co-operated with each other for so many years and we are confident of their support,â€™â€™ says rahurkar. the 300-year-old mandir and 150-year-old masjid stand dome to dome without even a token strip of white to separate the saffron from running into the green or vice versa. islamic words of prayer float past the mandir and the sound of bells can be heard in the masjid. to complete the tableau is the gloria church across the road which scorns the flyover in front of it and reaches straight for the sky. the half-century of respectful co-existence has become a metaphor, if not for something as utopian as religious brotherhood, at least for the kind of secularism envisaged by the founders of the modern indian nation.

''everyday, with police connivance, they defy curfew to burn and loot muslims' property,'' said deeptha achar, who teaches in the m s university, baroda. achar claims she was an eye-witness to police complicity in the violence. ''on march 1, five of us teachers were giving company to prof bandookwala's daughter after her father was removed to a safe haven. i heard two police constables telling the mob, 'we'll give you 15 minutes, don't go through the front door, go via the back door.' they were supposed to guard the house that was completely destroyed by the mob.'' these aggrieved gujaratis seek transparency and a community-wise break up of the victims of police firing. the government has been tom-tomming the number of deaths in police firing, but the eye-witnesses from the riot-hit areas have a different story to tell. ''on march 15, the ayodhya shila daan day, there was a maha arti in baroda that got converted into a rally. the rally turned into a mob as it got into a muslim area, macchipith, at friday juma time. when muslim youths pelted stones on the mob, the police that was accompanying the mob fired at the muslim youths,'' said kirit bhatt. according to these concerned citizens, the first target of the mob is muslim lives and property (not so much lives as property), then come hindus who help their muslim brethren, and then honest police officers. related stories

kolkata: annoyed over instances of corruption in the west bengal electricity board, bosses in writersâ€™ buildings and alimuddin street have pulled up state power minister mrinal banerjee. protests against corruption have cost a senior seb official his chair. cpm sources told tnn on saturday that chief minister buddhadeb bhattacharjee, cpm state secretary anil biswas and industries minister nirupam sen had openly expressed their displeasure over the power ministerâ€™s inability to check corruption in the seb. the issue was raised during a recent state secretariat meeting of the cpm by former transport minister shyamal chakraborty. according to sources, chakraborty submitted documentary evidence of corruption rampant in the seb. both bhattacharjee and biswas reportedly criticised banerjeeâ€™s consistent failure to stop malpractices in the seb. the matter came to a head when it was learnt the seb was making arrangements to purchase power meters worth rs 56.92 crore from the marketing agents of a rajasthan-based private company where a senior vhp leader reportedly has a stake. apart from the political ramifications of purchasing material from a company in which a vhp leader was involved, it was also observed that the price of the power meters quoted by the company was 40 per cent higher than sebâ€™s original estimated cost of rs 40 crore. allegations of corruption were also raised from within the six- member board of the seb regarding purchase of aluminium conductors worth rs 15 crore from another company. amitava roy choudhury, member (technical) of the board, had objected to the contract on the grounds that the concerned company was selling the same product to bihar and gujarat at a much lower price. at a board meeting of the seb last monday, when roy choudhury raised allegations of corruption, he was curtly asked to resign. when he refused to do so, the board was reconstituted the very next day. roy choudhury was the only member to be dropped from the board while all the others members were retained. in his dissenting note, roy choudhury brought charges of large-scale corruption in both the deals. â€œnecessary unbiased inquiry is required to be held from the proper level to find out the reason why malpractice was adopted,â€� he wrote in his note. he said he expected senior ministers in the state cabinet to intervene and order a full inquiry into both the deals. â€œonly then can corruption in the seb be stopped once and for all,â€� he said. power minister mrinal banerjee, who was in hyderbabd, was not available for comment.",0,0,0,0,0

gandhinagar: chief minister narendra modi''s increasing pressure on top government officials to ensure that the riot-displaced people go back home so that a facade of peace can be shown when prime minister a b vajpayee visits gujarat on april 4 are failing to bring about the desired results. official sources said that in the last 10 days the total number of persons living in 100-odd relief camps increased by 12,000 as the atmosphere of fear and terror continues in the state. on march 21, the number of refugees living in 98 relief camps was 97,517. on march 30, the figure went up to 1,09,503 persons living in 102 relief camps, disproving that things are beginning to return to normal in gujarat. the sharp rise also takes place a day before the all-party relief committee under governor s s bhandari holds its first meeting on sunday evening. secretariat sources said there was ""considerable pressure"" on the state health department officials to stop immunisation and other programmes it had undertaken to stop the outbreak of diseases. on the other hand, the ngos and managers of the relief camps were asked by the chief minister at a recent meeting in ahmedabad to stop supplying food as these were available in plenty with the government for distribution. he insisted that only non-edible items be distributed by them. there was also pressure on state health officials not to distribute eye glasses to fight the rising cases of conjuctivitis in six relief camps in ahmedabad. bypassing the political pressure, the department distributed several hundred glasses free of cost. informed an official, ""we undertook the immunisation programme despite political pressure"". top secretariat sources here said minister of state for civil supplies bharat barot is not alone who wants the relief camps closed down. the cm personally told the voluntary agencies and those running the relief camps in a meeting at the circuit house annexe in ahmedabad last on thursday that the situation has become normal, and there should be little reason why so many relief camps should continue to operate. confirming this, a senior member of an ngo quoted the cm as saying that the situation is fully under control and there is nothing to worry. modi reportedly said the media had created all the hype leading to people coming over to the camps. what is needed is a proper confidence-building process, in which the voluntary agencies can help out. he did not reply to the security concerns of the ngos. informed sources said the cm is of the view that one should break up those living in the relief camps into four categories - those whose houses have been burnt, those whose houses have been damaged in arson, those living in the vicinity where the riots had broken out, and those who had come to the relief camps just out of fear.

kolkata: even as gujarat burnt, neighbouring states of mad-hya pradesh and maharashtra remained peaceful, jamiat ulema-e-hind all-india president asad madani said in kolkata on sunday. this was because the governments in these two states resolved to ensure that violence did not spread to their areas. â€œafter the godhra incident, violence could have spread to various parts of the country, but the possibilities were suppressed by timely administrative action,â€� he said. even in many places of gujarat, hindus had helped their muslim neighbours. â€œwhile in some places they were successful, in others they were outnumbered by rioters.â€� accusing the narendra modi government of discrminating be-tween the dead, he said the gujarat government had announced a compensation of rs 2 lakh for the families of those killed at god-hra and a compensation of rs 1 lakh to those subsequently killed elsewhere in the state. â€œafter the delhi riots in 1984, families of victims were paid a compensation of rs 10 lakh. applying the same yardstick, all those killed in gujarat should be paid a compensation of rs 10 lakh,â€� said madani. about a thousand people had been killed and property worth more than rs 3,000 crore had been destroyed, he claimed after touring the riot-affected areas of gujarat. â€œeven yesterday, four people were killed and some houses were set on fire.â€� demanding the dissolution of the modi government, madani said, â€œwhat is worse, a section of the police themselves helped in the killings, while the army held flag marches.â€� any government functionary who connived in the killing of citizens of the country should be treated as its enemy, he charged. madani demanded a full investigation into the gujarat riots by a sitting supreme court or high court judge, as well as punishment for the â€œreal culpritsâ€� of the godhra killings. wondering how muslims could be involved in such a killing since burning anyone was against the tenets of islam, he said, â€œan in-quiry commission would reveal whether the isi was involved in the godhra incident.â€� he even demanded that â€œfascistâ€� organisations like the vhp, bajrang dal, shiv sena and rss should be banned.",1,0,1,0,1

former kolkata sheriff amiya gooptu believes bengal can make it to the top. as chairman of the independent think-tank bengal initiative, he shoulders the responsibility of leading the group in chalking out growth paths for the region. holding mutiple posts including the trusteeship of academy of fine arts, president of indian council for cultural relations and bengal table tennis association, working president of society for preservation and directorship of reputed companies, he took time off to speak to subhro niyogi on bi. what is bengal initiative? it is an independent think tank without any political association and comprises successful people who volunteer to take upon themselves the responsibility of coming with new and fresh ideas. bi was first formed around 1905 during the swadeshi days at the instance of visionaries like p.c. ray, dadabhai naoroji, c.r. das, upendranath sen, f.n. gooptu and others. it was a time when native chambers of commerce were not strong enough and the indian business community did not have a representative voice. bi emerged as a spokesman for indian interests and prepared action plans on education, social welfare, media, tariff policies and employment generation. times have changed. but the over-riding compulsion for self-improvement has not. after over nine decades, bi continues to seek and uphold the same values of its august predecessors. what is the primary concern at bi today? west bengal today occupies the fifth position in terms of trade and development in the country. the immediate concern is to ensure that the state tops the chart. it does not end there though. for in a globalised economy, bengal has to compete with the world. and we have a long way to go before we catch up with the rest. instead of setting gujarat or maharashtra as the yardstick, bengal has to look at cities in china or south-east asia. only then can you become a role model state in the country. so bi believes that bengal has the potential to turn as competitive as the nations to its east? definitely. west bengal is historically, culturally and geographically placed to make the quantum leap. just saying that the state has the potential to become indiaâ€™s gateway to s-e asia is not enough. the dream has to be realised. west bengal, the northeast, nepal, bangladesh, bhutan, myanmar, sri lanka, thailand and south china comprise a 450 million people market. the vision has to extend beyond borders. one of the biggest export opportunities for bengal is on the culture front. and yes, there are opportunities in healthcare, education, tea, jute, food processing, information technology and other sectors. could you elaborate on culture being a potential export? bengalâ€™s culture is a brand. our heritage, language, literature, music, dance, art, theatre â€” they are revered the world over. yet, the exposure has not been to the desired level. and there has been hardly any efforts to package it for the audience outside the state. rabindranath has drawn upon cultures in the east on many occasions, be it tasher chandalika or chitrangada. they just need to be packaged for the particular audience. bengali cuisine too is a part of our culture. given the similar diet on fish and rice, there are opportunities galore to hardsell bengali cuisine in these countries. has bi been able to achieve anything in this direction? bi delegations has been visiting several countries to bring people closer to each other. last year, we visisted myanmar. it was the first indian delegation to the country for a long time. the decision to re-establish embassies in kolkata and mandalay can perhaps, be attributed to the visit. china too must have a consulate in kolkata. what are the areas in the government where a change is necessary? everyone in the government has to be honest about their work. advanced nations have administrations that are speedy and transparent. perhaps, thatâ€™s because public opinion is very strong there. why canâ€™t our ministers hold departmental press conferences three or four times a year? one has to realise that the mandate does not entitle them to be answerable to the people once every five years.

mumbai: civil rights activists have demanded that the inquiry into the riots in gujarat be conducted by a panel of sitting judges of a high court outside gujarat or the supreme court. only that would ensure an independent inquiry given that an atmosphere of coercion and brutality still prevailed in gujarat, they said. the activists, including girish patel, fr cedric prakash and sophia khan, said that since the stateâ€™s complicity in the rioting was evident, a retired judge from the gujarat high court appointed by the government would not be able to deal with the issue objectively. besides, they said, justice k.g. shah, who had been appointed to the inquiry commission, was not in the best of health. the reason for demanding a representative panel of sitting judges and not a single retired judge was that the appointment of the former was made by the chief justice and of the latter by the state, said activists mihir desai and teesta setalvad. concerned citizens have also pressed for an expansion of the terms of reference of the commission appointed by the government. they want it to include the buildup of the political and social atmosphere which led to the incidents at godhra and the rest of gujarat. meanwhile, observers from mumbai, who are now in gujarat, say that atrocities against the minorities in gujarat continue, although on a reduced scale. the villages on the outskirts of anand have doggedly resisted violent threats to their muslim inhabitants. to pressurise the hindus from these villages, the local vhp has been sending them a set of bangles every day. but so far, the locals have held out. â€œwe learnt that two days ago a minister from the state cabinet addressed a meeting of villagers decrying them for not having taken to violence,â€™â€™ said activist sushobha barve. she said what was happening in gujarat was not communal rioting but ethnic cleansing, genocide. there was also a serious problem of sanitation in relief camps. the bajrang dal, in the last couple of years, has created a trained, private militia. every account that the observers received before their arrival in gujarat, which was corroborated on arrival there, points to the role played by such an outfit in the recent carnage. in every incident in gujarat in the last few days, the mobs leading the attacks were not the usual riot mobs.they were five to 15,000 in number, collected swiftly, and they destroyed life and property quickly and brutally.",0,0,0,0,0

ahmedabad/vadodara: riot-hit denizens of gujarat are resorting to whatever means possible to save their homes and commercial establishments. after arming themselves with hockey sticks and baseball bats, they have now taken to wearing their religion on their sleeve, literally. all this just in case a mob makes a mistake and they end up getting caught in the crossfire. when rioters began torching shops in ahmedabad, the owner of mehfil restaurant could not help cursing himself for giving his joint an urdu name. in a last-ditch attempt, he put up a board outside saying: ""jai shri ram. proprietor-partner rg singh and balwant singh"". mehfil, near the sattadhar crossing on sola road, remains intact. ''jai shri ram'' and posters of hindu gods and goddesses have now become passwords to survival for those who live in mixed localities or have controversial names that can be mistaken as belonging to that of the minority community. a perfect example is naroda-patia where hindus and muslims lived together in a labyrinth of houses. since the gruesome massacre in which nearly 75 persons were killed, only a handful of hindu families have remained as they have no option. and they are letting the world know they are hindus. posters of goddess saraswati have been prominently displayed at entrances. while ''jai shri ram'' is ubiquitous, a combination of vegetables is another way out. the first thing many hung outside their shops after the riots was the tried-and-tested chilly-lemon combination. garment shops along c g road, with names which could raise eyebrows, all had the combo hanging outside. mango leaves were also in demand. after an automobile showroom on the sarkhej-gandhinagar highway as burnt down, satnambhai, who does not have any specific name for his shop, has lined the entrance of his garage with mango leaves - a traditional hindu way to bring good luck. fresh swastiks, the symbolic om and ''jai shree ganesh'' are among the signs that surfaced overnight on the walls and shutters of mechanics and grocers at naroda, bapunagar and memnagar in ahmedabad. on the samjuba hospital road in bapunagar, the all-glass bajaj showroom was spared only because ''shri ram'' was prominently painted on the panes. in vadodara, a number of houses have ''ram'' painted on their doors in bold while shopkeepers have hung boards proclaiming: ""this shop belongs to a hindu"". fear has also led many to keep coconuts on a kalash near their doorsteps. in karelibaug, some societies have pasted posters of hindu gods and goddesses at their gates. after all, rioters have to be stopped early, before the first stone is pelted.

patna: the cpi(ml)'s 'loktantra bachao' rally on thursday called upon all secular and progressive forces of bihar to reiterate their resolve to defeat the communal, fascist offensive and thereby save and strengthen democracy in the country. addressing a mammoth gathering here at the gandhi maidan, party's general secretary dipankar bhattacharya gave a fervent call to overthrow the vajpayee government to protect the country's secular foundation and national unity. in protest against communal frenzy, the party has decided to launch a national unity campaign throughout the country from may 4 to 10. bhattacharya, in his 45-minute speech, said the ruling rjd-congress coalition government in bihar had proved absolutely incapable of providing even a minimum sense of security to the toiling masses. the prevailing misrule of laloo prasad yadav is underlined by spate of kidnappings and massacres in the state, he added. the state is reeling under extreme economic backwardness. discredited political leaders of bihar add insult to the injury as they indulge in empty rhetoric and extravagant political shows in the name of development and reconstruction, bhattacharya said. the components of both the nda and rjd-congress coalitions are competing among themselves to promote criminalisation of bihar's economy and politics. they are squarely to be blamed for the state's alarming descent into an absolute anarchy, he pointed out. laloo ban gaya spokesman, he said, adding: now laloo is planning to go to delhi as a rajya sabha member to project sonia gandhi as a leader. bhattacharya said the party's red flag will be the torch bearer for making a new bihar. because all the so-called disciples of jp have become irrelevant, he added. he said development has never been even a key slogan for the scam tainted state government, while no union minister or so-called disciples of jp have succeeded in securing for bihar any concrete measures to match the development agenda. in this regard, he mentioned the names of union ministers nitish kumar and ram vilas paswan. bhattacharya said his party had already launched a movement for making a new bihar. we strongly believe that the question of development of bihar must be made the central agenda of politics. needs and aspirations of the toiling masses, youths and students must be placed at the centre of the state's development, he argued. the party has decided to donate a sum of rs 1 lakh for the victims of gujarat riots. he said at least 37,000 affected people are still living in 14 relief camps. they are being looked after by various individual groups, he said. the cpi(ml)'s thursday rally has succeeded in making its presence felt in residual bihar. a large number of contigents from champaran, darbhanga, katihar, madhubani, saharsa and kishanganj had arrived here to attend the rally. earlier, rallyists led by bhattacharya and other senior party leaders took out a procession shouting slogans like mandir ki rajniti band karo, ram ke naam kaa katleaam band karo from the southern side of the gandhi maidan at around 11 am, which, passing through exhibition road, chiraiyatand, station road, fraser road, terminated at the gandhi maidan. prominent among those who spoke on the occasion were ashok manohar of lal nishan party of maharashtra, akhilendra pratap singh (party's state secretary in uttar pradesh), mahendra singh (leader of the cpi-ml's legislature party in jharkhand), raja ram singh, mehboob alam and ram naresh ram (all party mlas from bihar).",0,0,0,0,0

""riots are not new to the state,"" mehta argued. ""they took place in 1969, 1985, 1992 and now in 2002. when the industry invests in the state, it fully takes into consideration the risks involved. despite the past riots, statistics show that gujarat has steadily progressed in industrial investment."" the reply was following the leader of opposition naresh raval''s argument that the direct damage to the units due to the riots was rs 3,000 crore. raval said, ""our image is down internationally. the british queen has taken note of it."" his deputy udesinh baria said general motors was contemplating shifting its plant from the state. mehta denied this and said he had ""checked"" with the gm officials and the news was wrong. gm officials had told the industries commissionerate on tuesday that they were going ahead with their fresh plan for investing rs 600 crore for manufacturing the new multi-purpose vehicle. mehta insisted that whatever slowdown one was witnessing in the state currently was because of the international recession. the growth rate in the us was down to 0.7 per cent now from one per cent a year before. india''s growth rate was down to 2.3 per cent in 2001-02 compared to 5.8 per cent in the previous year. and, because of the two droughts and the earthquake, gujarat''s growth rate was down to 2.23 per cent. yet, the state''s industrial growth remained at 5.05 per cent. mehta quoted the government of india figures to say that despite the recession, in 2001 till october, gujarat topped the list of foreign direct investment in india. of the rs 23,266 crore fdi approved, gujarat''s share was rs 6,185 crore, followed by rs 4,651 crore in maharashtra, rs 3,590 crore in tamil nadu, rs 1,138 crore in karnataka, rs 860 crore in delhi and rs 490 crore in andhra pradesh. raval, however, quoted the centre for monitoring indian economy figures to say that in cumulative terms, during august 1991 to november 2001, the state''s fdi share was 6.4 per cent of the country as a whole, compared to 17.46 per cent in maharashtra, 12.23 per cent in delhi, 8.33 per cent in tamil nadu and 7.78 per cent in karnataka. ""we stand no. 5 in foreign collaboration, without any doubt,"" he said. raval further referred to cmie figures to say that despite a huge rs 1,68,016 crore of intended investment in gujarat, in 2000-01, the rate of implementation was 47.47 per cent, down from 66.31 per cent in 1994-95 and 56.21 per cent in 1997-98.

ahmedabad: gujarat''s image of being a progressive state has taken a major beating because of the recent communal riots. this statement came from none other than wipro chief azim premji while speaking to gujarati businessmen in ahmedabad on saturday. according to him, the riots have put the state back by a few years in terms of future investments. ""don''t underestimate the homework that multinational companies (mncs) do on their potential investment destinations, especially in terms of the city risk and state risk. they will not set up operations in ahmedabad or gujarat because the risk is too high,"" premji warned the gathering at an interactive session held at the ahmedabad management association. the gujarat government too came in for scathing criticism on its attitude towards the information technology (it) sector. premji minced no words when asked about his views on the reasons why gujarat had been a non-starter in it. ""the gujarat government has been sleeping on this issue. state governments have to aggressively market themselves and deliver on those promises, which other state governments like karnataka, andhra pradesh and maharashtra have successfully demonstrated. but the gujarat government has failed to do this."" ""we have development centres in all these states and could have had one in gujarat too as 12 per cent of our work force is from gujarat and i''m sure they would like to work closer to their homes and families but this hasn''t happened because of the state government''s attitude,"" he added. delivering the convocation address at the indian institute of management, ahmedabad''s 37th convocation later in the evening, he chanted the mantra of managing change for the passing-out students. ""while change and uncertainty have always been part of life, what has been shocking over the last year has been the quantum and suddenness of change,"" he said. ""for many people who were cruising along in placid waters, the wind was knocked out of their sails."" according to premji, while sudden change always gets attention, it is the gradual change that is ignored till it is too late. ""you must develop your own early warning system, which warns you of changes and calls your attention to it. in the case of change, being forewarned is being forearmed."" he also told the students that the fear of the unknown was natural. ""with change comes the feeling of insecurity. many people believe that brave people are not affected by this malady. the truth is different. everyone feels the fear of the unknown. courage is not the absence of fear, but the ability to manage fear without getting paralysed."" these were but two of the 10 pearls of wisdom that he dropped for the students.",0,0,0,0,0

though i hold no brief for the communal bjp, jagmohanâ€™s well-meant drive against illegal constructions is the single most important factor which went against the bjp. jagmohanâ€™s drive didnâ€™t go down well with our self-obssessed middle class which is not capable of seeing beyond its grubby noses. it ganged up against the honest minister and got him shunted to another portfolio. our people are not willing to accept certain minimum obligations that other free countries have imposed on their citizens. i have little hope from the congress. jagtar singh, chanakyapuri the anti-incumbency factor, jagmohanâ€™s highhandedness in bulldozing illegal constructions, and the infighting among the partyâ€™s mps from delhi contributed to the bjpâ€™s debacle in the mcd elections. the gujarat riots and the partyâ€™s kid-glove treatment of the vhp on the ayodhya drama also took secular votes away from it. further, the party didnâ€™t endear itself to the salaried class by imposing more taxes on them and raising the prices of essentials like lpg. it is hoped that with the congress controlling both the state government and the mcd, there would be better coordination and easy availability of funds for development. bhaskar bhatt, pari bari marg. the bjp corporators were busy promoting their own interests at the expense of the common man. they never bothered to address the issues of erratic water and electricity supply, health care, pollution and transport. the recent role of the central government in gujarat and ayodhya only contributed to its debacle in the civic elections. one is not sure whether the congress, which now controls both the state government and the mcd, will be able to address the woes of the delhiite. r.l. pathak, lodhi colony. the decline of the bjp started in 1999 itself when it took over the government at the centre by abandoning the basic issues on which it had got votes. it abandoned the issues of the ram temple, article 370 and a uniform civil code for the sake of power. then the stunts it enacted â€” like the bus yatra to lahore â€” only made it unpopular with people. it failed to control subversive elements. it failed in kargil. it inducted ministers with a criminal record in the up ministry and marginalised honest ministers like jagmohan. it entered into unholy alliances in assam and karnataka for the assembly elections. it persisted with finance minister yashwant sinha despite the fact that this man had failed to deliver on any front. the bjp has run out of steam and its future is bleak. the temple issue will not mobilise votes for it now. well, yes, the bjp has failed delhi. but the congress is not a remedy either. the record of its state government doesnâ€™t inspire much confidence. k.r. rai, janakpuri the bjpâ€™s reckless drive against illegal constructions in delhi and its handling of the communal carnage drove people away from it. it is now downhill for the bjp. it has been routed in four states, and its future at the centre looks bleak.delhiites are not fools to expect much from the congress. the party has a poor track record of development. vidyasagar, yojana vihar every action has a reaction. the poor record of the bjpâ€™s councillors was bound to hit its prospects in the polls. there was chaos as for as civic amenities were concerned. the state government, controlled by the congress, said something, and the mcd, controlled by the bjp, said something else. the two were working at cross-purposes. its finance minister yashwant sinha did not help matters by fleecing the middle class by imposing more burden on them.with the congress controlling both the state government and the mcd, let us hope there is a better coordination between the two. p.n. sachdev, anand vihar. the reasons for the bjpâ€™s rout in the mcd elections are obvious enough. its drive against illegal constructions, the anti-poor budget, the gujarat riots, the anti-incumbency factor, and the rumblings in the nda contributed to the partyâ€™s debacle in delhi. with the congress at the helm in the state and the mcd, more funds will ensure more development. it is up to the congress how it seizes this opportunity. o.p. bansal, janakpuri. by slicing off a huge chunk from the income of the middle class, the bjp antagonised its traditional vote bank. second, in connivance with the business community (which it represents), the party pursued an erratic policy on liberalisation and privatisation. people could see its game plan. third, it failed to rein in the rss, the vhp and the bajrang dal. and the party continues to persist with narender modi who is stoking the communal fire in his state. expect no better days for delhi because the congress is equally communal and power-hungry. ashok gupta, bali nagar. the bjpâ€™s anti-encroachment drive drove people away from it. the budget applied no balm on the bruised middle class either. anupam jain, rajinder nagar. the muddled budget and the communal riots did the bjp in. people see the bjp as incapable of governing. see how it is turning a blind eye to the shenanigans of the so-called sangh parivar. who are these people by the way? how many hindus do they represent? they are a bunch of self-serving middle-class people who donâ€™t have to bother about their bread and butter. they must be curbed and handed down stiff penalties. only then does the bjp has any future. the congress is the other side of the same coin. expect no respite, delhiites. manish kumar, gk-i.

""we will not plead for mass promotion as it has in the past harmed the career of the students, the judiciary has also in the past criticised such a move"" maintains nsui district president karansinh. he added, ""so as to avoid further delay, we would urge the ngu authorities to entrust the examination work to the respective colleges."" on the other hand, the some parents too have criticised the move of postponing the examinations.

even after three weeks of turbulence in ahmedabad and ayodhya, the fm has remained stoically silent. perhaps it hasn''t struck him that some scientific exercises need to be undertaken for assessing the impact on the economy and the conclusions need to be shared with business. in gujarat, businesses are now trying to figure out ways of staying competitive nationally. global competitiveness is passe. but one must not assume that he is ignorant. may be he has already appointed a global consultant to work out financial implications of the situation and one hopes that the harvard graduates would find some way of extrapolating the future course of events in naroda and narol. incidentally, the bjp (oops, sorry, nda) government has spent quite liberally for buying business advice from abroad. unmindful of the expanding end usage of lpg cylinders, he nonchalantly rolled back prices by rs 20 a cylinder last week. in an equally uncharacteristic reaction, the media used the word rollback rather sparingly and even failed to call him saffron sinha, for having reduced the cost of arson. never mind. as ''kautilya'' jairam ramesh of congress says, the costs are being met with dollars provided by nrgs. the hike, even sans the rollback, would have been less than a dollar! it is increasingly being realised that economic disparities can be as much a consequence of, as a reason behind, communal flare-ups. mundane issues like unemployment and education are beginning to find their way back into dictionaries of modern economic thinkers, though reality is yet to bite the sensex. ase is, in fact, gung ho about its plans for trade in commodities futures. when will india realise that speculation is a rich man''s game? trading in cotton futures was banned in 1967 because volatility in prices exceeded all limits. futures have been re-introduced for imparting stability to cotton prices! interest subsidy and deferment of sales-tax and energy bills for riot hit industrial units have been announced but that is unlikely to be of much help. there is no way a business can be compensated for loss of markets in today''s intensely competitive environment. besides, what is the guarantee that there would be no flare ups in future? clearly, besides the temporary relief measures, political and social solutions have to be found, with some sense of urgency. one indicator of the extent to which human revulsion can affect business is the fact that surat weavers are willing to forego a good four per cent of their sales (cenvat credits) for staying free from the clutches of excise officials! believe it or not, many would close shop but would not have anything to do with excise officers. corporate news that came in last week was essentially old hat - gipcl''s 160 mw power plant has secured gas linkage, government is planning to sell its stake in gspc, amtrex hitachi hopes to hike sales by 40 per cent and arvind is upbeat on denim. mcdonald''s made its debut in ahmedabad, amul announced more launched and etv, which is reportedly being eyed by zee, earned high ratings in the last few weeks. perhaps the only interesting news was that while corporate bank officers are planning a strike on 30th because the management is not offering a vrs, bank of baroda employees would go on a strike on 30th because the management is going ahead with a vrs. some politico should recognise the opportunity and demand reservations in vrs. inadequate news from corporate circles need not really cause worry. the level has been low for quite some time. as has been said earlier in this column, growth interregnums are very essential for improving the quality of life. aren''t religion and spiritualism the buzz words now? notwithstanding the claims of the fm and the readings of the barometer that the sensex is supposed to be, the macro scene continues to be gloomy. everything seems to be at a standstill. business has been gripped by inaction. whether it is indeed possible to do something about the state of affairs is an open question but at least one can be spared the agony of having to read false claims of growth! down south, and up north, everybody is asking why riots take place so frequently only in gujarat? the question is being asked by those whose women are unable to drive two wheelers because their society isn''t decent enough. do not panic. time never fails to heal. sooner or later, things would stabilise. back in 1945, who had imagined that germany and japan would be able to regain their respective positions in the global hierarchy? of course india isn''t germany or japan but make no mistake, gujarat has been, and shall always be, india''s japan!",0,0,0,0,0

""it is a reflection of the distraught state of mind the society is in. people are so scared, they would rather leave the dead in cold than stick their necks out,"" said a doctor. interestingly here, more than 120 badly charred bodies had remained unclaimed till as much as a week after the communal mayhem gripped the city in the post-godhra massacre. a number of them were later identified and handed over to the people of the same area. those that were simply not identifiable and had no claimants were disposed off by the authorities after according them the last rites as per their religion ascertained from circumstantial evidence. but presently, the situation is different. doctors say there are also bodies that may or may not be those of the riot-hit.

""gujarat is a prosperous state and indeed a nice place to settle down but the communal riots have completely changed the perception,"" says arshad alam, a senior auditor with the comptroller and auditor-generalâ€™s ahmedabad office. alam hails from bihar and has gone on a monthâ€™s leave after riots broke out in the city. he has not ventured out since then and has sought transfer. ""there are various facets to this issue and needs a policy revamp regarding such transfers,"" says raghubir singh, principal accountant-general, adding he will accept applications for transfer and forward them to his delhi office. javed hashmi, who works with the indian space research organisation (isro), is, however, optimistic. he says that the atmosphere will improve after some days as nobody wants to continue with an abnormal situation. ""getting a transfer is not a solution. i enjoy my relations with my colleagues and other people at work. so why leave this place?"" says hashmi. but such voices are indeed rare in an atmosphere gripped by fear and mistrust.

1249,1109,"ahmedabad: â€˜â€˜the perpetrators of the gujarat bloodbath will be brought to the book,â€™â€™ resonates the political machinery at the centre, time and again. though a deluge of firs referring to mob violence accounts for the bloodied chapters of gujarat, in the end, the guardians of law may simply let loose the offenders with minor punishments. for, death sentence or life-term imprisonment may or may not be meted out to an offender, if a given case is converted from â€˜â€˜murderâ€™â€™ to â€˜â€˜murder in dacoityâ€™â€™, apprehend legal experts. they even have expressed serious doubts about the real killers of the recent riots ever being prosecuted, leave alone, being held guilty of the heinous crimes. sources said cases on the gruesome killing of 128 persons in the naroda-patia and chamanpura areas of ahmedabad during the riots could be given a turn with heavy pressure to replace from the firs section 302 (murder) of the ipc with sections 396, 397 and 398 of the ipc, which relate to â€˜â€˜murder in dacoityâ€™â€™. legal experts believe this possible move may just give a leeway to the offenders and could tone down their offence. the meghaninagar police, investigating the chamanpura incident in which former congress mp ehsan jaffri was also killed, have arrested 18 persons in the case. there are doubts too if the heavyweights named in the firs will ever be arrested. about the chamanpura case, the police say: â€˜â€˜to start with, we had lodged the fir under section 302. but on questioning the witnesses, it was found that there were incidents of dacoity too.â€™â€™ but legal experts say while conviction in murder would automatically lead to a death sentence or life imprisonment, a conviction under sections of â€˜â€˜murder in dacoityâ€™â€™ concludes with death or imprisonment for life and fine or rigorous imprisonment for 10 years and a fine. in other words, the guilty can get away with a 10-year term that is not possible under section 302. criminal lawyer b m gupta says: â€˜â€˜these are cases of brutal murder and cannot be scaled down to dacoity.â€™â€™ and, interestingly, police officers admit that they have been under pressure against arresting offenders or booking them under serious offences. joint commissioner of police m k tandon, however, said such talk of â€˜â€˜replacing the sections is nonsenseâ€™â€™. the riot victims may feel they are on the path to getting justice by having filed the fir. but as advocates helping some of the victims are realising, the police may have skilfully manipulated many of the firs to ensure that the accused go scot-free. all they have to do is accuse a faceless mob of the violence, effectively ensuring that the fir ends up as just another piece of paper. with no specific person accused, the police will not be able to make any arrests even if they want to. citizenâ€™s initiative, a consortium of 28 leading ngos in the city, has collected a large number of, what are known as, â€˜omnibus firsâ€™ where the name of the accused is given as â€˜â€˜a mob of 10,000â€™â€™ or â€˜â€˜an unruly mobâ€™â€™.

1250,1153,"new delhi: the ongoing hindutva-or-power debate in the bjp had its echo at a meeting of its parliamentary wing on tuesday. the prime minister made it clear he had no intention to let this government go as no one else was coming forward to step into the breach. ""we should stay on in the government because we have a responsibility towards the people,"" and not because ""we want to cling to power"", he said. however, in a concession to the hardliners, he said a ""middle path"" which avoided confrontation and allowed the bjp to stay on in power had to be found to resolve the ayodhya issue. this line was earlier taken by home minister advani, who cited the government''s many achievements, including pokhran, and noted that it had already completed four years - more than any other non-congress government despite the many obstacles in its path. party sources said the pm''s remarks came after rajya sabha mp bp singhal (vhp chief ashok singhal''s brother) hit out at the leadership, saying it had lost all credibility with the cadres after the bjp gave up on the temple agitation. worse, it retreated each time the allies made a noise. with only a year-and-a-half remaining of the present term, it would be better to quit power and return to the hindutva agenda. he asked how could the pm entertain the shahi imam of jama masjid who, he alleged, was an isi agent and an admirer of osama bin laden. lal muni chaubey, the mp from buxar, took the other line. as the bjp did not have the numbers, it sought the help of the nda parties to form the government and they came together on the basis of a common agenda which eschewed the ayodhya issue, he said. let us not lose sight of the fact that we came to power on that agenda, he said, adding that going back on that commitment would be tantamount to dhokabaji. the bjp had to accept that for the next 20 years it could rule only through a coalition. the line pm took on tuesday, rss sources stressed, is in sharp variance with its own line - that this government should go, preferably on the ayodhya issue in the next few months. but, bjp sources say, the pm is determined to stay on as it is evident that without the allies the bjp won''t be able to return to power. as the pm himself said, the subject merited a longer discussion. he has asked parliamentary affairs minister pramod mahajan to fix a date for it. but party sources said it wasn''t likely to take place in the near future as the bjp national executive - which will assess the current political situation - is scheduled to meet in goa on april 12, 13, 14. the party leaders would like tempers to cool down before a full-fledged decision.

lucknow: with the joint session on poto over, delhi is learnt to have got down to decide the names of advisors to the up governor. names of 14 retired and serving ias and ips officers have been shortlisted for the final pick. sources said that the central government was all set to send three advisors to assist governor shastri, including one each from the ias and ips cadres along with one from any of the minority communities, preferably a muslim. â€œthe appointment of the advisors, however, should not be seen as an indication to the tenure of the central rule in the state,â€� said a source in the state home department adding that it would not be surprising if the advisors'' tenure lasted a couple of months only. while the names of three recently retired ips officers had already figured in the list of 14 approved by the union ministry of home affairs, that of a retired firebrand dgp, who was at the helm of affairs during the ayodhya turmoil under the mulayam singh yadav regime, was scrapped by the prime minister''s office (pmo). the reason stated was his association with the mandir issue during his service. another name that was taken up for serious consideration was that of another up cadre ips who retired from a top rank in the central bureau of investigations (cbi). his candidature too, however, was cancelled by the pmo. while a recently retired dgp of the state and a retired ips officer of the rajasthan cadre were among the favourites in the ips section, on the ias front, the names of a retired bureaucrat who held a senior post in the food and civil supplies department at the centre and that of a former chief secretary of the state and another retired ias, who has had a stint in lucknow, too figured prominently for consideration. other names doing the rounds are those of an ias who recently retired from a senior post in the board of revenue and a up cadre bureaucrat from a minority community who had served in the parliamentary affairs department. sources said that an emissary from delhi was expected to visit the raj bhawan in the next few days for final discussions on the names before the list is announced.",0,0,1,0,0

hyderabad: as the ayodhya drama threatened to spill over to the old city of hyderabad on friday, for once, women stepped out of their households and proved to be a deterrent in preventing violence. they simply formed a human chain, wedging between the namazis and the policemen to vanquish any act subverting peace. more effective than the umpteen platoons posted outside the mecca masjid, about 40 women volunteers of the confederation of voluntary organisations (covo) barricaded the sloganeering youths, forcing them to abide by the peace call. but, despite their peace overtures, stray incidents of violence were reported from the lal darwaja area. three schoolboys had sustained stab injuries in a mob attack. yet, had there been no congregation of the peace-loving in the mecca masjid area, the outcome may have been heart-rending. â€˜â€˜we had taken an oath that come what may, we would not allow the human chain to be broken, even if it meant having to suffer stone-pelting,â€™â€™ said noorjahan, a senior member of the mahila sanatkar, the womenâ€™s wing of covo. and their resolve did pay off dividend: the human chain lasted half-an-hour, by which time the situation in the charminar area returned to normal. according to noorjahan, the chain was formed by women who belonged to both hindu and muslim communities. â€˜â€˜on seeing our resolve and unity, even women who were sitting inside buildings on the roadside came out and joined the chain,â€™â€™ said a beaming noorjahan. the women peace volunteers had decided early friday morning itself that they would form the chain only if the situation seemed tense. â€˜â€˜that is why we waited until the sloganeering started, which usually triggers a clash between the namazis and the police. â€˜â€˜our aim was to make sure that the situation did not worsen to such an extent that the police decide to enter the masjid and order a lathi-charge. we are happy that the police did not have to use much force,â€™â€™ says noorjahan. credit also goes to the dcp, (south zone), govind singh, who agreed to the covo plan.",0,0,1,0,1

ahmedabad: with the state government invoking the essential services maintenance act (esma) to stop college and university staff from going on a flash strike before the crucial final exams, many have said the move was uncalled for. the government had invoked esma on march 13 fearing that the gujarat non-teaching staff federation may stick to its word on striking work just before the forthcoming final exams. with the academic fraternity already under stress because of communal tension, the officials did not want any further trouble from the various unions in the university, sources said. they were also going by the history of the unions, which have generally called an agitation just before exams as it is the best way to arm-twist the government into accepting their demands. one of their main demands has been filling up the many vacancies for both teachers and the administrative staff in the affiliated colleges. ""there was no need to invoke esma especially when we had already informed both the government and the gujarat university of our decision to not to agitate this time,"" says k s shastri. ""they imposed esma on march 13 while we had written to them on march 3. we will have to let them know that there was no need for such harsh measures."" sources, however, added that this was a precautionary measure to ensure that the rest of the exams pass off peacefully.",0,0,0,0,0
1256,1245,"new delhi: prime minister vajpayeeâ€™s gujarat visit next week may spell the beginning of the end of narendra modiâ€™s dispensation in the state, say well placed sources in the government. continued violence even after his delhi visit, his defiant demeanour and his shooting from the hip at the media, the opposition and even parliament, have made modiâ€™s position untenable, these sources point out. though unofficial, the announcement of vajpayeeâ€™s visit a week in advance has acquired a political significance. the message is that the pm has decided to ignore the pressures from the sangh parivar to retain modi. for starters, the centre may ask governor s s bhandari to send a report on the situation in gujarat to begin belatedly the constitutional process. that this has not been done for over a month, has not been noticed by political observers and constitutional experts familiar with past actions of the union government of the day. for the ruling bjp, which considers gujarat a testing ground for hindutva, the charge of a relation between the gujarat violence and the movement for the ram temple in ayodhya is embarrassing for its long-term plans. that the violence has spread to rural areas, is considered unprecedented and dangerous in official circles. sources in opposition and even in the ruling nda, point out the gross incongruity in the centreâ€™s constitutional behaviour. that the same party (bjp) dominates the government at the centre and runs the government in gujarat â€” coupled with a senior member of the sangh parivar holding the gubernatorial post â€” has permitted a measure of political sanguinity that has now become the talking point in political circles. for instance, it has been pointed out that even when the congress enjoyed power in centre and states â€” with senior partymen in raj bhavans â€” violence of a political nature, so widespread, ferocious and prolonged, was never permitted. according to durga das basuâ€™s treatise on the constitution, article 356 was utilised precisely a hundred times till 1997 and since then, another five times. defections, either local or organised from delhi, altered the numbers in legislatures to cause constitutional breakdowns in several cases. but in a majority of the cases, such breakdowns caused law and order situations that needed to be quelled by imposing presidentâ€™s rule. most recently, when violent disturbances occurred in manipur in protest against the extension of naga ceasefire, the vajpayee government quickly imposed presidentâ€™s rule. but in contrast, in gujarat, violent riots have been going on for over a month now and reports about the partisan role of the police and state government are legion but the centre doesnâ€™t seem unduly concerned.
