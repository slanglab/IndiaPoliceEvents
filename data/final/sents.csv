4853,258,10,"but the rjn was created well before 1993, and it would be a travesty to hand it over to it even if it floated a fresh trust.",0,0,0,0,0
4854,258,11,"not just that, the supreme court had pointed out in 1994 that extra land had been acquired by the centre so that in case the title suit was eventually won by the muslims, ""their success should not be thwarted by denial of proper access to enjoyment of rights in the disputed area by exercise of rights of ownership of hindu owners of the adjacent properties"".",0,0,0,0,0
