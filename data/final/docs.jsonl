do the vhp or the babri masjid action committee represent us?â€™â€™ â€œlet the court decide,â€™â€™ was a common refrain, but prashant found that fraught with danger. â€œthe judges have to decide whether a ram temple existed at the very spot where the babri masjid stood. both sides have presented truckloads of documents. it will take the court years to go through them. besides, the vhp has already said it wonâ€™t accept the verdict. is any government likely to force them to accept it? should the credibility of the courts be allowed to be eroded? this is a political battle, should we force the court to resolve it?â€™â€™ ayodhya had become a money spinner for all concerned, says prashant, pointing out how the two lawyers representing both sides travelled to court together and shared a cup of tea after the daysâ€™ hearings. except of course for the people of ayodhya, who have been adversely affected. hindus control the temples and the trade and both these depend on pilgrims. â€œsince 1992, the number of pilgrims has come down to 10 per cent of the original. there are no cooks left in some temples because there arenâ€™t any pilgrims.â€™â€™ the team found the people of ayodhya living in terror, â€œthe terror of the hindutvavadis and the mahants, who move around with commandosâ€™â€™. at a function organised by the team,ayodhyaâ€™s children depicted republic day by showing parliament house flanked by a trishul dripping blood on one side and a bombthrowing terrorist on the other. â€œthe people of ayodhya have to decide the matter because their lives depend on it,â€™â€™ said prerna desai of the team. â€œneither can they give their children a good education, nor can they concentrate on their business. they have to be on constant alert 24 hours day.â€™â€™ it was difficult at first to hold joint meeting of the two communities. in a muslim meeting, youth asked angrily whether the team thought the demolition legal, and if they didnâ€™t, didnâ€™t justice demand that the babri masjid be rebuilt there? the teamâ€™s answer: â€œundoubtedly, but how? will you be able to build it without taking the majority community with you?â€™â€™ the same reply was made to the hindus. â€œthereâ€™s no way the government can allow the vhp build the temple there. the supreme court judgment, the nda allies, wonâ€™t allow it. if the temple has to be built, you will have to convince the muslims.â€™â€™ the consensus that emerged was that both places of worship should be built on the spot. the team had a strong argument favour of this: â€œeven if we agree that the idols of ram were not planted inside the temple but suddenly appeared there (in 1949), what does that mean? why did ram lalla choose a masjid appear in? because he felt masjid was the purest place him. and nobody threw him out. such was the maturity ayodhyaâ€™s residents that they accepted that in a masjid, ram lalla can stay, and in a mandir, the koran can be kept.why should let outsiders divide them now?â€™â€™ but how does one keep them out?

{"doc_id": 192, "doc_text": "This story is from March 11, 2002\n\npune: even as gujarat burned in the aftermath of the godhra killings, communally-sensitive mumbai remained peaceful. this has been attributed in large part to the prompt action taken by the 30-odd mohalla committees which have been set up to ensure that religious sentiments do not flare up as they did in the past. pune, too, has been following the example of mumbai by nurturing the mohalla committee movement. the city has no history of sustained communal rioting; the worst was in 1965 during a ganpati festival; others have been confined to pockets of the city. while the anatomy of a communal riot is very complex, and whether a city falls victim to it or not depends on several factors, the mohalla committee concept is one well worth pursuing. around 30 mohalla committees exist throughout pune. they were set up in the wake of the devastating communal conflagration that engulfed neighbouring mumbai ten years ago. \"the 1992 riots in mumbai were a iesson for us and we decided that pune should not become like mumbai. we earnestly started contacting neighbours and soon had excellent co-ordination, not only with the police, but also the municipal ward officers and corporators,\" says gita vir, member of the koregaon park mohalla committee. the mohalla committee, she says, tries to build up a sense of belonging in a community. this creates a feeling of unity and hence of security. as the events of gujarat proved last week, the participation of the police would be crucial. deputy commissioner of police (zone one) vinod lokhande, who supervises the ''communally sensitive'' areas of the city, confirms that the once a month meeting of all mohalla committees is extremely useful in maintaining harmony. \"we urge members not to give vent to their anger no matter what happens. we also teach them precautionary measures, how to defuse rumours and when to alert the police,\" lokhande says. essentially, the mohalla committee members could be the voice of reason that is required when the mischief starts. seventy-nine-year-old anantrao vavhal is an active member of the cantonment mohalla committee. in april last year rumours about stone pelting and burning of the quran were doing the rounds and it was essential to defuse the situation. \"an angry mob had gathered and we were worried about what would happen. so we took some of the community leaders to the spots where the outrage was supposed to have occurred and showed them that nothing had actually happened. the tension slowly defused,\" vavhal says. rajni behel is a member of the uday baug mohalla committee and used to work in a mohalla committee when living in mumbai. \"we have already created an excellent atmosphere in the locality and the rule is we mention only our nationality. religion is kept inside the home and we don''t allow public displays of religious ceremonies,\" she says. she is worried, though, that young people are not taking an interest in this activity, a sentiment echoed by vavhal. vir would like much more participation from the public. there are many retired police officials and ex-servicemen who can get involved. \"in mumbai, people like (former police commissioner) julio ribeiro have devoted themselves to the movement and it has paid rich dividends.\" mohalla committee members in pune say that the police have always been extremely co-operative. julio ribeiro told times news network that \"no police officer wants communal trouble in his area, so the police always encourage such initiatives\". in mohalla committees he is involved with in mumbai, the police are encouraged to participate in health camps and computer classes to build up a feeling of trust among minority communities. ribeiro says every major city must have mohalla committees irrespective of whether it has a history of communal riots or not. \"recently, noted billiards player geet sethi requested me to go to ahmedabad with him so that we can start the movement there. we plan to go this week and start the good work,\" says the former ''super cop''. he also sounded a word of caution when it comes to recruiting people into the committees. \"only honest and sincere people who have a good character and no political ambition must be chosen,\" he advises.", "doc_labels": ["ANY_ACTION"]}

{"doc_id": 307, "doc_text": "This story is from March 11, 2002\n\npune: even as gujarat burned in the aftermath of the godhra killings, communally-sensitive mumbai remained peaceful. this has been attributed in large part to the prompt action taken by the 30-odd mohalla committees which have been set up to ensure that religious sentiments do not flare up as they did in the past. pune, too, has been following the example of mumbai by nurturing the mohalla committee movement. the city has no history of sustained communal rioting; the worst was in 1965 during a ganpati festival; others have been confined to pockets of the city. while the anatomy of a communal riot is very complex, and whether a city falls victim to it or not depends on several factors, the mohalla committee concept is one well worth pursuing. around 30 mohalla committees exist throughout pune. they were set up in the wake of the communal conflagration that engulfed neighbouring mumbai ten years ago. â€œthe 1992 riots in mumbai were a iesson for us and we decided that pune should not become like mumbai.we earnestly started contacting neighbours and soon had excellent co-ordination, not only with the police, but also the municipal ward officers and corporators,â€� says gita vir, member of the koregaon park mohalla committee. the mohalla committee, she says, tries to build up a sense of belonging in a community.this creates a feeling of unity and hence of security. as the events of gujarat proved last week, the participation of the police would be crucial. deputy commissioner of police (zone one) vinod lokhande, who supervises the â€˜communally sensitiveâ€™ areas of the city, confirms that the once a month meeting of all mohalla committees is extremely useful in maintaining harmony. â€œwe urge members not to give vent to their anger no matter what happens. we also teach them precautionary measures, how to defuse rumours and when to alert the police,â€� lokhande says. essentially, the mohalla committee members could be the voice of reason that is required when the mischief starts. seventy-nine-yearold anantrao vavhal is an active member of the cantonment mohalla committee. in april last year rumours about stone pelting and burning of the quran were doing the rounds and it was essential to defuse the situation. â€œan angry mob had gathered and we were worried about what would happen. so we took some of the community leaders to the spots where the outrage was supposed to have occurred and showed them that nothing had actually happened. the tension slowly defused,â€�vavhal says. rajni behel is a member of the uday baug mohalla committee and used to work in a mohalla committee when living in mumbai. â€œwe have already created an excellent atmosphere in the locality and the rule is we mention only our nationality. religion is kept inside the home and we donâ€™t allow public displays of religious ceremonies,â€� she says. she is worried, though, that young people are not taking an interest in this activity, a sentiment echoed by vavhal. vir would like much more participation from the public. there are many retired police officials and ex-servicemen who can get involved. â€œin mumbai, people like (former police commissioner) julio ribeiro have devoted themselves to the movement and it has paid rich dividends.â€� mohalla committee members in pune say that the police have always been extremely co-operative. julio ribeiro told times news network that â€œno police officer wants communal trouble in his area, so the police always encourage such initiativesâ€�. in mohalla committees he is involved with in mumbai, the police are encouraged to participate in health camps and computer classes to build up a feeling of trust among minority communities. ribeiro says every major city must have mohalla committees irrespective of whether it has a history of communal riots or not.â€œrecently, noted billiards player geet sethi requested me to go to ahmedabad with him so that we can start the movement there.we plan to go this week and start the good work,â€� says the former â€˜super copâ€™. he also sounded a word of caution when it comes to recruiting people into the committees. â€œonly honest and sincere people who have a good character and no political ambition must be chosen.â€� â€¢faraskhana : 13 (70 meetings at chowkis) â€¢vishrambaug : 43 (79) â€¢khadak : 19 (112) â€¢deccan : 21 (65) â€¢kothrud : 7 (63) â€¢samartha : 10 (45)", "doc_labels": ["ANY_ACTION"]}

Â Â hindi    a petition was filed by the centre before the lucknow bench of the high court comprising justice sudhir narayan, justice rafat alam and justice bhanwar singh praying for a direction that the hearing of the case relating to the dispute be taken up on a day-to-day basis. the court granted time till march 18 to the parties for filing replies to the application while posting further hearing on it to march 19. the application filed before the full bench through additional solicitor general r n trivedi comes in the midst of fresh intiatives taken by the centre to resolve the ram janmabhoomi-babri masjid dispute, especially a day after the kanchi shankaracharya floated a formula for breaking the deadlock. trivedi impressed on the court that under the acquisition act of 1993, the union of india was statutory receiver with the obligation to maintain status quo till the disposal of the suits. it was spending about rs 30 crore annually in this regard, he added. it was submitted that in view of the sensitive issues involved, it would be appropriate if the disputes were resolved as early as possible. the additional solicitor general said so far the testimony of 23 witnesses have been completed. the examination and cross-examination of witnesses sometimes took 12-15 days. zafaryab jilani, appearing for sunni wakf board, objected to the maintainability of the application on the ground that the centre was never a party to the dispute. a manan, appearing for one of the plaintiffs, also wanted to file objections to the centre''s application. r l verma, appearing for one of the parties to the suit also sought time to file reply to the application. trivedi responded that in the dispute between the parties, the union of india was not a necessary party but in its capacity as the statutory receiver it could not be said that the centre had no locus standi to file an application for early hearing. the high court had in 1989 directed that four title suits originally filed before the civil judge, faizabad, be transferred to its lucknow bench for original trial of the case relating to the ownership of the disputed area at ayodhya. all the four suits were now pending before a special full bench of the high court. after the demolition of the disputed structure in ayodhya in 1992, the disputed area and the adjacent area was acquired by the centre under the provisions of the acquisition of certain area at ayodhya act (accaaa), 1993. the validity of this act was challenged in supreme court in 1994, which had upheld the constitutional validity of the acaaa. under section 7 of the act, faizabad divisional commissioner is entrusted with the responsibility of maintaining status quo in the disputed area till the transfer of property is made by the centre on resolution of the dispute to the party found entitled to it in accordance of the final adjudication of the issue by the court. the four title suits for the determination of the true owner of the disputed area were being heard by the court and till its adjudication the centre as the statutory receiver has to maintain status quo, trivedi said. the centre said as statutory receiver it was administering the property in a befitting manner considering the sensitivity of the issue, the threat perception to the makeshift structure and the volatile law and order situation, which was often fuelled and worsened by religious passions. this has necessitated flow and utilisation of huge manpower and financial resources to maintain status quo and law and order in the area and pointed out that government was spending rs 30 crore on the maintenance and security of the area alone, trivedi said. the application also said the centre was holding and managing the additional land measuring 70 acres adjacent to the disputed area to implement the final verdict of the high court. \"in view of the nature of the issues involved, their importance and sensitivity and consideration of national interest, which impelled early resolution of the dispute on an urgent basis, the central government is vitally interested that the suits be decided at an early date,\" it said. related stories:Â kanchi seer postpones return homeÂ kanchi seer offers new peace formula for templeÂ land cannot be given to vhp  \n\nFacebook Twitter Linkedin Mail", "doc_labels": ["ANY_ACTION"]}

{"doc_id": 664, "doc_text": "new delhi: after a series of whirlwind meetings with central ministers, the vishwa hindu parishad (vhp) and muslim leaders, swami jayendra saraswati, the shankaracharya of kanchipuram â€” the latest mediator on the ayodhya issue â€” said that the vhp had agreed to await the verdict of the of the supreme court on the disputed site. but if this appeared like some movement forward, he also seemed to present the nation with a fait accompli by endorsing the vhp stand that bhoomi pujan be permitted on march 15 on the land acquired by the centre in 1993 and that this land should be handed over to the ramjanmabhoomi nyas well before june 2, when the 100 day yagna in ayodhya ends. he asked the muslim personal law board to give its approval for the handing over of this acquired land. what is being presented as a ''concession'' â€” in a letter the ramjanmabhoomi nyas wrote to the prime minister on tuesday â€” is that till the title suit about the disputed 40 by 80 feet spot on which the babri masjid stood is decided, that area will not be touched. but vhp vice president giriraj kishore said no such proposal had been made yet. \"we have not taken any decision. if the proposal comes, the dharmacharyas will decide on it, \" he said. he, however, did reiterate that \"we have said we will not go to the disputed area for now\", adding that the allahabad high court must take a decision in the pending case on the basis of documentary evidence furnished by the vhp and not witnesses. the shankaracharya further stressed that the ram idol would remain virajman at the sanctum sanctorum and the daily puja would continue in the pendency of the title suit. in short, if construction begins on the adjacent acquired land, then there will be no way that the area can ever be restored to the muslims, even if the title suit is decided in their favour eventually, since the construction that will begin will follow the master plan which envisages the disputed spot as the sanctum sanctorum. kishore, meanwhile, ruled out compromise on the three demands made on monday: that all restrictions enforced in ayodhya be lifted, shifting of carved stones to the undisputed site be allowed and the undisputed land be handed over to it before june 2 for construction to begin. on any other issue, he said, \"we have an open mind\". the vhp leader confirmed that both the kanchi shankaracharya and the rss were mediating between the parishad and the government on handing over the undisputed land to them for construction, and hoped the issue would be solved through mediation. any solution, however, had to come by march 12 and the government would have to begin removing hurdles in the way of temple construction, he said. regardless of the government''s stand, he said, material for construction would begin to be moved to the undisputed land at 2.15 pm on march 15, and construction would begin at the site of the shila pujan on any mahurat before june 2, when the 108-day yajna ended. kishore \"appealed\" that the only way communal tension on the issue could be eased was by the \"muslims showing large-heartedness and giving up their claim on the ram janmabhoomi. this will help hindu-muslim unity.\" insisting there were no decisions yet from the meetings that the shankaracharya had held, kishore said the kanchi seer was engaged in ensuring that the government hand over the undisputed land to the trust for construction to begin. the shankaracharya too said there was no legal hurdle in the way of the government accepting the demand. the government on its part, was in the process of consulting its nda allies, he said. the ram janmabhoomi trust, he said, had given him a written undertaking that no activity would be undertaken on the disputed site. on the government''s part, he said, the prime minister would consider all issues and put the centre''s stand before parliament. \"everything will be done before march 15,\" he said. he stressed that \"status quo will be maintained at the disputed site\" and that construction on the undisputed land would not hamper entry into the disputed site. the religious leader also held meetings with representatives of the muslim personal law board and other muslim leaders. board spokesman kamaal farooqi said the seer had made a proposal for a solution which would combine \"both dialogue and a court settlement\", refusing to divulge further details. the board, farooqi said, had neither accepted nor rejected the proposal yet and would deliberate on it on march 9, after which its decision would be communicated to the shankaracharya. political observers say a compromise seems imminent and the vhp''s hard line is a last-ditch face-saving effort before it gives in on some of its demands. the shankaracharya, who had once met prime minister atal bihari vajpayee on monday night, met the latter again late on tuesday to discuss the issue. there was no official briefing on the meeting.

{"doc_id": 258, "doc_text": "new delhi: the vajpayee government is building a case for handing over to the ramjanambhoomi nyas at least part â€” if not the entire â€” 67 acres of land in the immediate vicinity of the demolished babri masjid acquired by the centre in december 1992. highly placed sources in the government say that if the acquired land is divided into \"essential\" land â€” needed to maintain the security of the disputed 40x80 feet on which the mosque stood as well as access to it â€” and \"superfluous, excess\" land beyond it, \"there should be no objection\" to handing over the latter to the vhp. not just that, the sources maintain there are provisions in sections 6 and 7 of the acquisition of certain area at ayodhya act, 1993, which entitle the centre to hand over the land to the rjn. the reason why the vhp''s demand is being given such serious consideration is not merely the organisation''s capacity for trouble, but a growing sense in the ranks of the bjp leadership â€” after the party''s abysmal performance in the recent assembly elections â€” that only the revival of the hindutva card can infuse a fresh life into a moribund organisation. at the same time, a section in the government feels that, given the current \"surcharged atmosphere\" in gujarat and elsewhere in the country, this is not the right time to hand over the land, for which the vhp has now announced a fresh deadline of june 2. but the question is: if handing over part or all of the acquired land to the rjn was so simple, why has it not been done thus far? official sources say there are three options on handing over of the land. the first is handing over the \"superfluous\" land as that would still ensure the security and access to the disputed spot. but in 1994, the supreme court, in its advisory opinion on the validity of the acquisition act, had said that not just the fate but the extent of the \"superfluous\" land could only be determined after the title suit for the disputed spot was decided. next comes section 6, which is also being invoked as an option and which, incidentally is the one generally touted by the vhp: that the land can be given to any trust created after 1993, provided it adheres to conditions imposed on it by the government. but the rjn was created well before 1993, and it would be a travesty to hand it over to it even if it floated a fresh trust. not just that, the supreme court had pointed out in 1994 that extra land had been acquired by the centre so that in case the title suit was eventually won by the muslims, \"their success should not be thwarted by denial of proper access to enjoyment of rights in the disputed area by exercise of rights of ownership of hindu owners of the adjacent properties\". and finally section 7, which says that the acquired land can be managed either by the centre or a person/ body of persons/ trust so long as there is no change to the land till the title suit is decided. in short, if the centre invokes section 7 to give the land to the rjn, no construction can begin anyway. related storiesÂ hand over ayodhya land by june 2: vhpÂ shankaracharya meets pmÂ up govt determined not to allow build-up of kar sevaksÂ babri masjid panel threatens to move scÂ security to be tightened further in ayodhya  \n\nFacebook Twitter Linkedin Mail", "doc_labels": []}

{"doc_id": 638, "doc_text": "journalists constantly wring their hands over the growing criminalisation of politics, and call on political parties to choose better candidates. such moral lecturing is vacuous. criminals are not entering politics because of some inexplicable moral lapse by candidate selection committees, but because they have huge incentives to get in. to get them out, we must change the incentive system. many laws need changing, but one single change can have a huge impact. let the law provide that criminal cases against legislators will be heard before all others on a day-by-day basis to ensure a quick verdict. in one stroke, that will create a huge disincentive for criminals to contest elections. many will resign from the legislatures to escape the consequences. today, criminals join politics to gain influence and ensure that cases against them are dropped or not proceeded with. the law disqualifies convicted criminals from fighting elections. but this does not keep criminals out of politics because legal delays, often abetted by political pressures, make convictions of resourceful crooks rather rare. criminals threaten witnesses with death, and the feeble state cannot protect them. so we need a radical change. i wonder why public pressure for such change is not greater. our standards have dropped so far that we no longer realise how outrageous our situation is by international standards. when i tell foreigners that our legislatures are full of bandits, they smile incredulously. surely you mean, they say, that bandits assist your legislators? no, i insist, the bandits are the legislators. at which point the foreigners look appalled and foxed: they cannot understand how this can be so in what claims to be the worldâ€™s biggest democracy. a casual look at last weekâ€™s events shows how commonplace is the mixing of crime and politics. exhibit 1: the gujarat police say the man behind the godhra massacre was a local muslim politician, a feared don. exhibit 2: mansoor ahmed, samajwadi party mla, was shot at a public meeting. his family says the killing was staged by a political rival, tanveer ahmed, who was denied the samajwadi ticket and so contested, unsuccessfully, on the bsp ticket. gang killings and political killings are becoming indistinguishable. exhibit 3: ram sewak gautam, a policeman who had the temerity to raid the premises of don-cum-politician dp yadav and track down his son vikasâ€”who is accused of murderâ€”was transferred in the middle of the murder case. most newspapers ignored this. it is no longer news that officials seeking to catch political criminals get sidelined. look further beyond last week to the up assembly elections. according to india today, 965 of the 5,539 candidates who contested the up elections had criminal records. that is a whopping 17 per cent of all candidates. why are political parties so happy to adopt criminals as candidates? to understand the answer, recall max weberâ€™s definition of the state as the only entity that can use force with impunity. the rule of law is supposed to ensure that anybody else who uses force is jailed. but in india, a weak police and legal system ensures that mafia dons get away with murder. they can use force with impunity. so, a la weber, the mafia have as much legitimacy, in practice if not in theory, as the state. a criminal who can collect protection money is as powerful as an official tax-collector. a don who can use force to settle disputes is actually superior to the state, which is unable to settle disputes because of legal delays. a criminal candidate who can capture and stuff ballot boxes is, in our twisted democracy, on par with a popular politician who wins every vote. normally officials will report booth capturing, but not if the capturing don can credibly threaten them with death. besides, dons have lots of money, which is very useful for fighting expensive election campaigns. india has no system of public funding to enable honest people to meet election costs. black money is needed in hoards, and here criminals have a huge comparative advantage. in the up election, mayawati auctioned several candidatures to the highest bidder. so, according to reports, did the samajwadi party. obviously, criminals will get the better of honest folk in such auctions. why do dons invest large sums in getting tickets? because a ticket to the assembly is a ticket to kickbacks and extortion using political power. since the legal system no longer penalises theft, politicians who steal have a comparative advantage over others. returns on political investments are so high that criminals are disinclined to invest in tax-free rbi bonds. politics is so much more profitable, and just as tax-free. so, our system has unwittingly created huge incentives for criminals to enter politics. in the long run, we must clean up the legal and police system. meanwhile, we need quick steps to change the incentive structure. one is to provide public funding for elections. that will reduce the comparative advantage of criminals, and increase that of honest candidates. the second is to have a blanket ban on defections, a major source of political profit. any legislator who defects or disobeys the party whip in a vote of confidence should be forced to go back to voters for election on a new election symbol. those who split a party should go back to voters too. that will restore some meaning to representative government. but the most far-reaching measure, surely, will be to give automatic seniority to cases against legislators, which should be heard on a day-by-day basis. atal behari vajpayee, you need to find a new way of reviving the sagging fortunes of your party. why not try to seize the high moral ground by introducing a bill to prosecute criminal legislators quickly? your law minister, arun jaitley, will surely comply. true, such a law will be dismaying for mafia dons in your own party. but other parties have even more of them, and will suffer even more. what are you waiting for?\n\nFacebook Twitter Linkedin Mail", "doc_labels": ["ANY_ACTION"]}

â€œitâ€™s said that a prominent hindu gen-tleman who wanted a son made an offering at the church. his wish was granted and word spread,â€™â€™ says fr dâ€™abreo. adds fr michael dâ€™souza, the parish priest, â€œthere are people who have come every sin-gle wednesday for years. i once asked a catholic gen-tleman who has been coming for 25 years what kept bringing him here. and he told me, â€˜i have never once fallen sick.â€™â€™ the church compound jostles with such storiesâ€” leaving little room for questioning and rationality. â€œmy mother was unable to have a baby,â€™â€™ says smita dongre, a domestic worker from santa cruz. â€œshe started a novena and i was born nine months later on christmas day. naturally i have vishwas.â€™â€™ adds mamta sheikh, a kurla housewife, â€œi first came to this church last february. our business was down, my husband wasnâ€™t getting a visa to the gulf, we were losing our house. we were planning to end it all by drinking poison.two months later, my husband got his visa, some cheques were cleared and every-thing changed.â€™â€™ as far as ms sheikh is concerned, the miracle con-tinues to unfold. â€œmy son sajid will be attending the evening service with his friendsâ€”one sikh, one hindu,â€™â€™ she says, pointing out that the novena brings disparate people together. â€œit makes us pray for each other, feel for each other, and reminds us that we all share the same fears and hopes. that is the most won-derful miracle of all.â€™â€™", "doc_labels": []}

{"doc_id": 337, "doc_text": "ayodhya: the continuing administrative squeeze around ayodhya and faizabad got tighter on saturday, with the cancellation or diversion of all trains reaching the twin towns till further notice. the last of the trains, carrying some 2,000 karsevaks from ayodhya, left town on friday evening. ironically enough, it was the sabarmati express, bound for ahmedabad in gujarat, the same ill-fated train which was attacked in godhra last wednesday. the lack of easy transportation to and from ayodhya has already begun to reflect in the numbers at karsevakpuram, the vhp headquarters in ayodhya. just before noon, the site of the purna ahuti yagna conducted every morning since february 24 looks deserted but for a dozen or so karsevaks. ''we have strict instructions not to let the media in,'' says the young volunteer in-charge of regulating the negligible human traffic to the holy fire. asked to explain the dwindling human mass, the local media in-charge of the vhp, sharad sharma, starts with a sullen denial. since the trains were stopped on friday, some 2,000 karsevaks arrived on saturday by other means. the local bjp leaders, re-elected mla lallu singh and the faizabad district party president mahant manmohan das, are more forthright. because of the administration's dictatorial ban on rail and road travel, religious-minded karsevaks are being prevented from reaching ayodhya, they complain. there are no exact estimates of how many karsevaks are still left behind in ayodhya. the figure varies from an optimistic 4,000 to an improbable 10,000. requests to visit ramsevakpuram — the semi-permanent township which houses the vhp volunteers — for an independent assessment, are firmly turned down. ''the karsevaks have told us not to send anyone from the media there... because the media can some times be too aggressive with its questioning,'' says sharma. that might be so, but he clearly has other things on his mind. on friday evening, a wire service photographer was manhandled inside ramsevakpuram and his chain snatched. just a stone's throw away from karsevakpuram, the administration has, in the past 24 hours, part-sealed the workshop where stone pillars for the proposed temple are being chiseled and carved. the gate used for bulk transportation has been locked up, with a single-file side entrance allowed for individual access. the men in uniform posted outside have orders not to let anyone unlock the main gate. but none of this is having a reassuring impact in the muslim areas of the temple town. from kutia to panjitola, kajiara to begumpura, the mood among the minorities remains grimly nervous. many families have moved their women and young ones to safer areas. but it is impossible to ascertain how many. mohammed salim, nephew of hashim ansari, the man who filed the original court petition against the installation of ram idols in 1949, claims that nearly every muslim family in panjitola located within shouting distance of the barbed-wire fencing that marks off the acquired land around the disputed masjid has seen some safety-driven migration. but in faizabad, khalil ahmed khan, of the faizabad helal committee, has compiled a list complete as of friday of those muslim families who have left ayodhya for safer destinations. while khan feels that the administration has clearer directions today than in december 1992 - both from the court and the central government to maintain the peace and status quo, there is ample room for concern.\n\nFacebook Twitter Linkedin Mail", "doc_labels": ["ANY_ACTION"]}

if so, on what dates were they burned and by whom and what is the action taken against the persons concerned?the long history of communal violence in godhra is not an unknown phenomenon, but it has taken an ugly and serious turn in the last 25-30 years. two families have been burnt alive in the same area in the past in a ghastly incident. and ten years ago, four teachers, including two women teachers, were mercilessly cut to death in a school in the presence of children.while the then congress rulers have registered court cases in a routine manner, they have failed miserably to punish the real culprits. not only this, the main culprit named asaraf was done to death while in a jail by other accused persons and the whole event was pushed into a corner forever.reports of the violence in ahmedabad give the impression that it was well organised. the reports said armed mobs went around with voting lists targeting muslims. an ias officer, harsh mander, has given a chilling account of the violence in ahmedabad. why has the state not been able to tackle the situation? there are allegations that the police was partisan. please comment.those who are acquainted with gujarat know that this state is very sensitive to communal violence. there have been serious communal disturbances triggered by petty and minor incidents relating to kite flying or a cricket match. in the past, communal violence has broken out in 200 places at a time and curfew has been imposed in about 300 villages and towns for months together.compared to this, the godhra massacre was unparalleled in history, but we took all proactive measures to curb the violence within 72 hours. the police fired more than 3,900 rounds initially and the army was airlifted from the border area and deployed within 16 hours in the disturbed areas. there was no complacency on the part of the government or the police.even now the situation doesn''t seem to be under control. what is the reason for this?there are about 18,000 villages in the state, of which disturbances were reported in no more than 50 villages. of the 242 municipal towns in the state, incidents took place in less than 40 towns. after march 3, no major incidents of violence have been reported. not only this, religious rituals were observed on the eve of holi in all 18,000 villages in a peaceful manner, while moharrum was observed with tazia processions at more than 1,000 places. ten lakh students have appeared in the ssc\\hsc examinations and the process of village panchayat elections is going on in a peaceful manner in about 1,700 villages.lakhs of pilgrims are on padyatras to reach dakor yatradham for the full moon day celebrations and in palitana, a famous jain pilgrim centre, lakhs of jain families are coming in from far-off areas. even in ambaji in north gujarat, thousands of pilgrims have come together for prayers. does this not suggest peace and normalcy in the state?there are allegations that you have moved out police officers who took a tough stance against the rioters. please comment.again, this is a false and misconceived allegation. the issue of promotions of police officers was long pending and it was purely an administrative decision. there was absolutely no political motive in the transfers of officers. those who are indulging in false propaganda are only damaging the morale of the forces.do you think that a section of the bjp itself is behind the campaign for your removal?i am getting unequivocal support from all the bjp workers and leaders of the state. they have been a constant source of encouragement and inspiration for my government''s fight against terrorist and anti-social activities. i am committed to protecting the people of gujarat. the talk of internal bickering is baseless and mischievous.is it true that you are in favour of mid-term elections in gujarat?it is unfortunate that when my entire focus as a leader of the state is to provide relief to all those who have been affected, such issues are being raised. my sole concern today is to bring total normalcy to my state and to create an atmosphere of mutual trust and harmony. in this grave period, i do not have any time to think of any political activity.two of your ministers are reported to have been in the ahmedabad police control room when the riots broke out in ahmedabad. what action do you plan against them?it has always been a tradition in this state for senior ministers to monitor and coordinate the rescue and relief measures from the control rooms. this is treated as a routine and regular exercise. during the earthquake, ministers were actively coordinating the relief activities from the police control room. i feel distressed to see that this also is being twisted by the media, with the sole objective of maligning my government.related storiesÂ low key holi in gujaratÂ violence continues in central gujarat  ", "doc_labels": ["FORCE", "ANY_ACTION"]}

the moment policemen know that the chief wants work to be done the way it should be done they fall in line. but if the leader is not clear in his thinking then things can go wrong. how did you go about bridging the communication gap between the police and the citizens?reaching the people was a more difficult exercise. fortunately for me, julio ribeiro returned to the city in april 1994 and teamed up with sushobha barve of the moral rearmament army who was active in the restoration of peace. they had a lengthy discussion with my men and we decided to initiate a dialogue with the aggrieved people. the first meeting was held in a mahim school with a group of 20 well-educated muslims. for nearly three hours we just listened to some very angry people. i had some idea of the intensity of their feelings but some of their statements were very provocative; they had come to the conclusion that the exercise was an eyewash. yet, we kept our cool.three days later, there was another meeting at mahim with another set of muslims. this meeting, too, stretched for three hours but the hostility was much lesser, the anger that used to show on their faces was absent. the third meeting, again at mahim, was exclusively with women. it was here that i first spoke out; i told them that i had not come to defend what had happened, my purpose was to ensure that such things would never happen again. for this, i needed their support. finally, it registered with the muslims that we were not being superficial.so, merely hearing out the aggrieved people helped you establish a rapport?what helped in changing the hard attitude of the people was that we allowed them to unburden themselves. from our side, we did not use a harsh word nor did we try to put them in their place. it has been my experience all through my police career that if you give a patient hearing to a man who has come with a grievance and allow him to unburden himself, quite a lot of his bitterness and anger goes away. you may not be able to do much because of legal constraints or procedural requirements, but that you gave him a patient hearing and allowed him to speak out without bullying him makes a big change in that person''s attitude.did you make amend the police functioning in any way as a result of the interaction at mahim?one of the complaints that the women had was that during any bandobust or festival, the police would routinely pick up all the young boys in the locality and lock them up for a day in the name of preventive detention. i assured them that not one person without a criminal record would ever betouched.how did you manage such productive interaction in communally sensitive localities all over the city?like sushobha, there were others, such as p.p. jamkhedkar in behrampada and bhau korde in dharavi, who had taken the initiative to restore peace in their localities. these people were instrumental in making the meetings possible. and it was at these meetings that the concept of mohalla committees emerged.how are your mohalla committees different from the earlier ones, which had worked wonders in bhiwandi?in the bhiwandi model, the police created and led the mohalla committees. our mohalla committees were people''s organisations. the informal leader of each mohalla committee is an apolitical person who has some standing in the area. he is the one who convenes the meeting, not the local police. the mohalla committee has no structure and no one gets any identity cards; these are just a bunch of citizens respected by the local police.did the police support mohalla committees just because you happened to be the commissioner?that must have helped, but the sub-inspectors and inspectors also realised that without public support their work would become very difficult in a big city like mumbai. at that time the inspectors were conscious of the fact that they were not being trusted by the muslim community and it rankled in their minds. hence, they were also willing to accept this principle of a partnership between the community and the police. mohalla committees basically brought citizens together to tackle their problems. at places the work of mohalla committee became so effective that the police station was willing to let them handle some minor matters.

what did gandhi do in the face riots? he walked.when violence raged across eastern bengal and bihar in 1946, that old man walked from village to village, talking to people and trying to restore sanity. â€œmy appeal here,â€™â€™ he would say, â€œis not to the muslims as muslims nor to the hindus as hindus, but to ordinary human beings who have to keep their villages clean, build schools for their children and take many other steps, so that they can make life better.â€™â€™ also, do you remember what pandit nehru did in 1947? he would rush into the crowds and physically separate people, even hitting a few. these leaders were willing to stake their life for communal harmony. and, in fact, it was the shock of gandhiâ€™s death which finally quenched the flames of post-partition violence in the subcontinent. what strategies did gandhi adopt to further religious tolerance and harmony? for gandhi, these were not just issues to be discussed at times of disturbances, but goals to be pursued constantly. his own prayer meetings were never conducted in temples, mosques or churches, but under the sky. and they always included elements from different religions. or take his 1934 movement against untouchability during which he covered 12,000 milesâ€”meeting groups of villagers day after day, and explaining that there was no justification for denying a fellow human being access to roads, temples or wells. leaders like sardar patel sometimes complained that he was diverting attention from the national movement. but gandhi always replied, â€œyou cannot postpone every problem to after independence.â€™â€™ the orthodox elements often opposed him, but gandhi always invited them onto the dais to express their views. one man in particular was very abusive and, once when gandhi was absent, the villagers beat him up. gandhi went on a weekâ€™s fast as penance and told his followers, â€œthat man has every right to express his opinions.â€™â€™ this, to me, demonstrates his approach to dialogue and conflict resolution. is there anything we can learn from these strategies? the whole world today recognises the need for non-violent conflict resolution. there are 350 university departments and learned bodies around the globeâ€”not just in countries like the u.s. and the uk, but in places like latvia and finlandâ€”which are devoted to this subject. they study gandhi as the prophet of non-violence, the man who turned a personal ethic into a tool of social and political action. but, strangely, universities and academics in india tend to ignore him. why do you feel that indians have forgotten gandhi? let me ask you one simple question. gandhiâ€™s autobiography used to cost rs 2, now it costs rs 20. how many people do you know who own a copy? as far as most educated, english-speaking people are concerned, gandhi was a political leader, someone who brought freedom to the country and deserves reverence on october 2. they donâ€™t see how much his life and principles still apply. if gandhi were alive today, he would have said, â€œunderstand me, donâ€™t praise me.â€™â€™ but this is precisely what we have failed to do. why is gandhi so relevant today? i recently read a book by howard gardner which identifies the seven geniuses of the 20th century â€”einstein, t.s. eliot, freud, stravinsky, picasso, martha graham and gandhi. the author contends that geniuses are people who solve not only the problems of their own time, but also foresee future problems. all the major issues of todayâ€”from religious tolerance to ecological devastationâ€”were foreseen by gandhi at the beginning of the 20th century. and he had something relevant and practical to say about each of them. unlike marx, whose principles were framed in a library, gandhiâ€™s principles were framed in the context of life. take his attitude towards religion. before embarking on his journey through riot-torn noakhali in 1946, gandhi needed a secretary who could speak bengali and he requested n.k. bose, the eminent anthropologist. bose declined, saying, â€œi wonâ€™t be able to work for you because i donâ€™t believe in god.â€™â€™ to which gandhi replied, â€œyou believe in truth donâ€™t you? that is good enough for me.â€™â€™ what prompted you to begin your 50-year-long quest for gandhi? on january 30, 1948, i was a civil servant with the railways, and was posted at the border town of ferozepur. as a student in lahore, i had never been an uncritical admirer of gandhi, but when i heard the news that he had been shot dead, i found myself crying inconsolably. â€œhow did this man get into my bloodstream?â€™â€™ i wondered.the very next day, i went to the bookstore at ferozepur and bought every single book about gandhi and the freedom struggle. and that day began my search for gandhi.", "doc_labels": ["ANY_ACTION"]}

{"doc_id": 962, "doc_text": "shabana azmi there is no denying that india has been a victim of terrorism, including cross-border terror propagated by pakistan for more than a decade now. hence, terrorism needs to be rooted out. but i am convinced the prevention of terrorism ordinance (poto), a draconian law, is impinging on our civil liberties and secular polity. like its predecessor tada, it will be misused. the conviction rate of tada arrests is a shocking 1.8 per cent. out of the 77,571 people arrested under tada, over 2000 were let off without trial because no evidence was found against them. surely, our fears that poto will be similarly misused should be addressed. instead we have home minister l k advani saying, â€˜â€˜those who oppose poto favour terrorism.â€™â€™ this shocking statement is like us president george bush announcing after september 11, in a cowboy style, â€˜â€˜either you are with us or with them (terrorists).â€™â€™ we are with neither. let this be clear. we oppose poto but that doesnâ€™t entitle anybody to cast a doubt on our patriotism or question our nationalism. it has been argued that poto is necessary to curb terror. how did the terror attack on parliament (december 13) happen, while poto was in existence? if poto had helped strengthen intelligence functioning, could the godhra carnage have happened? what then will poto be used for? the fear is, it will be used selectively against minorities. less than 48 hours after poto was passed in lok sabha, came reports that the ordinance has been selectively and widely used against muslims in gujarat, specifically those involved in the godhra incident. sixty people, all muslims, have been booked under poto. not one of the over 800 arrested for violence in ahmedabad and other areas of gujarat, have been booked under poto. it is obvious that for narendra modiâ€™s government, crimes by the minority community are considered more heinous than those committed by the majority and therefore more deserving of stringent punishment. for modi, the systematic targeting of families and putting entire neighbourhoods on fire is evidently not an act of terror. national security is of paramount importance. without protecting the security of a nation, individual rights cannot be protected. the worth of a nation is the worth of the individuals constituting it. â€˜â€˜the right to fair trial, the right of liberty and security of person, the right to freedom of expression, the right to redress and the right not to be tortured would all be at risk under poto,â€™â€™ is a fear expressed by amnesty international. law minister arun jaitley said, poto will clearly lay out for the police, the framework in which they can operate, thus they will not be able to misuse it. i disagree. similar repressive laws in the past have been used by the police to circumvent their usual course of probe. how do we deal with terrorism then? the nhrc says, â€˜â€˜a proper strengthening of the crime investigation and prosecution machinery and criminal justice system is needed. if there are a large number of acquittals today, it is not for the lack of laws, but for the lack of proper utilisation of these laws, lack of proper investigation and prosecution, and lack of adequate number of courts to try the offences. unless this root problem is readdressed, adopting draconian laws will only lead to their grave misuse.  \n\nFacebook Twitter Linkedin Mail", "doc_labels": ["ANY_ACTION", "ARREST"]}

''at this moment when communal disturbances are taking place in parts of our country, it is important that we summon our traditional spirit of tolerance in order to establish peace and harmony among our people, he said in a message on the eve of holi. linking holi with communal harmony, narayanan observed that the festival of colours is symbolic of the multi-religious harmony that has existed in the country for centuries and the spirit of toleration that has been the essence of country's culture and civilisation. apart from not celebrating holi this year, narayanan declared he would also not receive any visitor on the day. if the earlier announcements by prime minister vajpayee and home minister l k advani that they would not celebrate holi had a somewhat hollow ring given their own political culpability for failing to rein in a partisan chief minister, the president's declaration is tantamount to a moral vote of no confidence in the two leaders. (congress president sonia gandhi also decided not to celebrate holi.) narayanan's message takes on special significance against the backdrop of warnings by citizens' groups in gujarat that sangh parivar activists are planning fresh attacks on the state's beleaguered muslim community. according reports lakhs of copies of an inflammatory and seditious pamphlet are being distributed in ahmedabad calling upon saffron extremists to indulge in more violence during holi. openly inciting attacks on muslims, the anonymous pamphlet says, ''police and army you also beware, you are also hindus...you should also support hindus.'' as on past occasions, president narayanan has not minced his words when it comes to taking a stand against violence. his message does seem to be in consonance with the mood of most citizens — who cannot understand how the riots and violence in gujarat have persisted for as long as a month. related stories\n\nFacebook Twitter Linkedin Mail", "doc_labels": []}
{"doc_id": 1017, "doc_text": "new delhi: senior congress leader ghulam nabi azad, who is the longest-serving member of the congress working committee (cwc), was summarily shifted to jammu and kashmir as the president of the pradesh congress committee (pcc) on wednesday. before being shifted, azad was aicc general secretary in-charge of up, kerala and tamil nadu. azadâ€™s abrupt removal, which sent alarm bells ringing in congress circles, is not likely to be an isolated case. this move is being seen as a precursor to a series of changes in the party organisation. the organisational revamp and key changes at the state-level have been in the offing for several months but were delayed because of congress president sonia gandhiâ€™s preoccupation first with the assembly polls and then the parliament session. key changes in the party are expected within the next few days. senior party leaders were at pains to explain that azad was not being sidelined and that he was being moved to j&k to strengthen the party in the state which is due to go to polls later this year. congress spokesperson s jaipal reddy was quick to state that â€˜â€˜azad is one of the most trusted and competent leadersâ€™â€™, adding that his shift to j&k was similar to pranab mukherjeeâ€™s move to west bengal on election-eve. however, others pointed out that azad has been one of the most high- profile congress leaders and has always been entrusted with important party positions at the centre, adding that this is the first time that he is being sent to a state. he replaces mohammed shafi qureshi who had earlier resigned as pcc chief. it is also no coincidence that azadâ€™s removal comes barely a month after the partyâ€™s dismal performance in the assembly elections in up where the aicc general secretary was in- charge. congress circles are rife with speculation over the organisational changes. former uppcc chief salman khurshid is being tipped to replace azad as party general secretary. khurshid, however, is also in the race for the uppcc presidentship once again as there is tremendous pressure for the removal of the present state party chief s p jaiswal following the partyâ€™s poor showing in the assembly poll. party insiders said aicc general secretaries mahavir prasad, mohsina kidwai and oscar fernandes are also likely to be entrusted with other responsibilities. prasad, it was stated, will be replaced by a dalit and among the names being mentioned are former governor mata prasad, pravin rashtrapal from gujarat, g venkatswamy from andhra pradesh and h hanumanthappa from karnataka.\n\nFacebook Twitter Linkedin Mail", "doc_labels": []}

''the partners should rethink their position in the coalition in view of the violation of the nda agenda by the government with its connivance with the vhp on the ayodhya issue,'' cpm politburo member prakash karat told reporters. replying to a question, karat agreed that if some of the bjp allies decided to leave the nda, their admission into the people's front could be considered.

{"doc_id": 1132, "doc_text": "This story is from March 30, 2002\n\nbangalore: the political scene in karnataka resembles a cyclone-ravaged township, after the elections to four rajya sabha seats. flamboyant liquor baron vijay mallya stormed the field like a tornado, shook the edifice of the ruling congress, wreaked havoc in the bjp camp, left the janata dal shell-shocked and then moved to parliament house in delhi. while the congress and bjp are now pondering over what went wrong, janata dal is wondering what went right. let us look into the arithmetic of mallya''s victory: â€¢ mallya entered the fray as an independent. he had just 31 votes in his kitty __ janata dal parivar 23 (jd-u 19; jd-s 4), independents 6 and expelled bjp members 2. he needed 14 more. he had to fend for himself to get the extra votes. but he managed to get 15 more, that too first preference votes, upsetting all calculations. he secured 46. â€¢ mallya''s rival, bjp''s taradevi, who was short of just five votes (her party''s strength is 40), bit the dust as she could secure only 34. six of her own party legislators did not vote for her. neither did she receive any second preference votes. did the six partymen vote for mallya? the party says yes, while the legislators say no. â€¢ the congress, on advice from its high command, asked its 147 mlas, including four associate members, to cast second preference votes in mallya''s favour. it allocated 49 first preference votes each for its candidates janardhana poojary, prema cariappa and rajashekaran. the surplus four votes to each of them was allotted as a precaution. to the party''s surprise, poojary polled 50 votes (one more than the allotted quota), cariappa 45 (four less) and rajashekaran 44 (five less). how did the two candidates fail to get the full quota of votes? did the nine first preference votes go to mallya? it appears so. â€¢ result: mallya did not have to wait for the second preference votes to be counted. he secured 46 first preference votes __ more than that polled by two congress candidates. the big question here is: did six from the bjp and nine from the congress cross-vote for mallya? partymen are looking at each other with suspicion in both the camps. the bjp is the worst hit. its morale is already low, what with the national unit under flak over the gujarat massacre and ayodhya imbroglio, and the humiliating defeat in the recently-held elections __ the latest being the delhi civic poll. to add insult to injury, the state bjp is plagued with infighting, dissidence, groupism and personal animosities. that a bjp candidate could not secure the votes of members of her own party, considered at one time to have the most disciplined cadres, speaks volumes of the mess. the bjp has expelled the six, who it suspects of having cross-voted for mallya. more are said to be in the line of fire. at this rate, it is certain to lose the status of principal opposition in the state assembly. instead of looking within, fixing fences and putting the house in order, the leadership is pointing an accusing finger at the congress. it is high time the national leadership intervenes and drives some sense into the heads of warring members. whatever happened to the party''s dream of forming a government in karnataka, its first in the south? going by the happenings in the party, it looks the dream will remain a dream, at least in the near future. the congress too has reasons to worry. one, two of its candidates received less than the quota of first preference votes allotted. two, the said votes appear to have gone to mallya. it means open defiance of the party whip. the party cannot ignore the development. yes, in the past too, members have voted for individuals against the party''s wishes. this time it was too blatant. had not the party allotted surplus votes to its three candidates, one or the other would have even suffered defeat, causing acute embarrassment. the congress may be relishing with glee the mess in bjp, but it cannot lose sight of the fact that the janata dal parivar is regrouping. it won the kanakapura byelection against all odds and sent former pm deve gowda to parliament. the victory applied the brakes on the congress juggernaut. now, on ramakrishna hegde''s advice, the dal lent support to mallya, who in turn sent a scare in the congress camp and unsettled the bjp. some senior congressmen wonder why the party didn''t ask the high-profile mallya to contest as its candidate, than allow the dal to bask in his glory. after all he is a well-known face, a close relative of chief minister krishna, and an established industrialist who has his heart in karnataka. be it the congress or bjp, introspection is the need of the hour. the bjp must put its house in order if it is keen to prove it is still a force to reckon with in the state. the congress leadership must take a serious view of the cross-voting by some of its mlas. if it prefers to turn a blind eye to that, dissidence is bound to raise its ugly head sooner or later. dissidence was the main cause of congress''s defeat in the 1994 assembly elections. hopefully congressmen remember that. in the janata dal camp, there is excitement. mallya''s victory has given the parivar another shot in the arm, the first one being from kanakapura. but both the gowda and hegde factions are bewildered how mallya made it to the post. balram.singh@timesgroup.com or balramhs@indiatimes.com.

{"doc_id": 832, "doc_text": "new delhi: congress president sonia gandhi on friday made a blistering attack on the government in the lok sabha on the ayodhya issue charging it with openly collaborating with vhp in the wake of threat of \"dire consequences\" from bjp mps. participating in the debate on the motion of thanks to the president's address, the leader of the opposition said while there was no substitute for firm and resolute action on the issue, the prime minister and his colleagues have \"neither the will nor the capacity to deal with the vhp blackmail\". alleging that the bjp-led coalition took a \"u turn\" in the matter, she said the explanation for such a somersault lay in the fact that several bjp mps in a letter to the prime minister on march 7 threatened his government with \"dire consequences\". she said the \"u turn\" was reflected in the government earlier asking state governments to prevent all volunteers from proceeding to ayodhya but later telling them to provide police protection to those going towards the pilgrim centre. gandhi said she has documents with her regarding the sudden shift in government policy including the letter of bjp mps. in her 30-minute speech, the congress president accused the bjp-led coalition of \"caving in\" to communal forces and giving in to factional pressures overlooking national interests. claiming that the letter from bjp mps led to change in the mind of prime minister atal bihari vajpayee, gandhi said this resulted in the attorney-general being asked to intervene in the matter in the supreme court. she said people of the country felt that the prime minister and his government were \"neutral\" to vhp's plan till the prime minister instructed his attorney-general to plead for this plan in court. gandhi said what happened in the apex court on march 13 shocked the nation about the \"duplicity of the government agenda\". \"central government's acts of omission and commission on ayodhya are shameful to say the least,\" she said. turning to gujarat, she blasted the narendra modi government over the handling of recent violence in the state saying the \"complicity\" of the government in the incidents stood thoroughly exposed. she hit out at union home minister l k advani for giving a \"clean chit\" to the state government and the chief minister. asserting that the continuance of \"irresponsible and callous\" government in gujarat was an affront to the country's secular polity, she demanded that the judicial probe into the violence be conducted by a sitting judge of the supreme court. on the issue of national security, gandhi said there was \"no no evidence\" of a clear-cut strategy on the part of the government on jammu and kashmir and that people in the state continued to suffer while security forces faced grave risk. she regretted that even after two years of its submission, the house had been kept in the dark on the report of the subrahmanyan committee on kargil conflict and its implementation. the congress leader wanted to know from the government the progress on the list of 20 terrorists and criminals wanted from pakistan, whether islamabad's approach to cross-border terrorism has changed and the response of the international community to the speech of president pervez musharraf on january 12. she lashed out at the prime minister for re-inducting george fernandes as defence minister when the venkataswami commission was continuing with its probe into the tehelka expose. \"the prime minister has given fernandes a clean chit but what message has gone to the judge (probing the expose),\" gandhi said, adding the central vigilance commission reports on corruption had been \"hushed up\" and journalists exposing corruption in high places being targeted. in an

{"doc_id": 764, "doc_text": "new delhi: jehadi groups in pakistan and underworld dons like dawood ibrahim, chhota shakeel and abu salem are planning terror attacks against those they hold responsible for killing muslims in the recent communal riots in gujarat. this has been learnt from several reports received by intelligence agencies recently. the intelligence bureau has submitted a report to the government including the prime minister on the matter. the report says some of the targets are functionaries of the gujarat government including chief minister narendra modi, some police officers of the state and leaders of pro-hindu organisations. ayodhya along with symbols, institutions and gatherings of hindus are also part of their planned targets. the report says pakistan-backed terrorist groups operating in jammu and kashmir see the prevailing scenario as an opportunity to make recruitments for their respective outfits from amongst muslims who have been affected by the riots. this is expected to enable these organisations to extend their activities to regions beyond kashmir. the groups have decided not to claim responsibility for any terrorist act perpetrated under this arrangement, since it could have an adverse impact on the pakistani establishment, the report says. the ib has learnt from reliable sources that jehadi groups, particularly lashkar-e-taiba, have deputed their cadres to plan and organise shootings and explosions in ayodhya. pakistani nationals are supposed to act as spearheads for such terror acts, in tandem with some local muslims. there are also reports of firearms including ak-47 rifles, grenades and explosives being moved from south kashmir to designated areas in up and nearby areas. in fact, there are indications that sahaba sainik, a bangladesh based pro- let group, has plans to infiltrate 800 of its supporters from bangladesh into the north-east to perpetrate terror attacks. the assessment of the intelligence agency is that whereas it took the underworld a few months to organise the â€˜â€˜retaliation to the demolition of the babri masjidâ€™â€™ in 1993, this time the response may be even quicker since experience of recent years has shown easier access of terrorist outfits to weapons, explosives and other hardware on account of caches that are believed to have been created in different parts of the country. both the pmo and the home ministry are believed to be agitated about the reports and are said to be monitoring the situation. they have asked the administration in up, gujarat and other sensitive areas to be on the alert on this account.\n\nFacebook Twitter Linkedin Mail", "doc_labels": []}

{"doc_id": 1057, "doc_text": "This story is from March 31, 2002\n\nmumbai: as the plague of communal hatred ravages gujarat and threatens other parts of the country, attempts are under way to understand the pathology of this deadly disease. realising that the ayodhya virus is only part of the problem, social scientists are wondering why some groups are more susceptible than others. at a seminar hosted by mumbai university and the all india muslim obc organisation this week, eminent muslim academics from across the country turned their scrutiny inwards. while the three-daylong meet was organised to discuss the problems of the muslim backward castes, many presentations and discussions turned to the overwhelming questions of the moment. why are indian muslims always projected as a single, monolithic group without cultural and social variations? why does the community allow a handful of self-styled leaders to hijack important issues? why are all attempts at debate and discussion squashed so summarily? \"itâ€™s a bad time for muslims in india because of the growing sense of insecurity and vulnerability,\" says imtiaz ahmed, the well-known sociologist at jawaharlal nehru university in delhi. \"the big challenge ahead is the need to understand that communalism cannot be fought with communalism. alternate approaches are essential, but the present leadership will not allow it.\" indeed,many problems stem from a leadership which is neither representative nor empathetic. instead of encouraging the community to break out of mental and physical ghettoes, these masters of manipulation feed fears and suspicions. \"bodies like the all india muslim personal law board (aimplb) and the haj committee claim to speak on behalf of the community, but are monopolised by a handful of upper-class, upper-caste muslims who want to safeguard their positions of power,\" says anwar alam,an academic with jnu,who presented a paper on the need for democratisation within the muslim community. \"they have deliberately fostered a culture of blind obedience and stifled dissent by raising the hoax cry of â€˜islam in dangerâ€™.\" concurs m.a. kalam, a wellknown anthropologist with the university of madras, \"anybody who dares question their stand is attacked.\" even the smallest deviation from orthodoxy is greeted with shrieks of protest, ensuring that larger issues are left unchallenged. \"i recently started a column for a hindi newspaper, but it was discontinued after three weeks,\" says mr ahmed, who unwittingly ruffled feathers while responding to a question about whether it was okay for a muslim to touch the feet of an elder while saying salaam. \"i explained that while salaamâ€™ is a religious tradition, touching feet is a valid cultural tradition.this caused a huge uproar.there is just no room for debate within the community.\" little wonder, then, that only reactionary voices are heardâ€”and so tend to define the â€˜muslim standâ€™ on critical issues like ayodhya. \"you will oftenfind hindus disagreeing with the vhp. but you rarely find muslims publicly objecting to the stand of the all india muslim personal law board,\" says mr ahmed, who has filed a case in the supreme court, protesting about the governmentâ€™s willingness to negotiate with the likes of the vhp and aimplb, but not with the other, liberal factions. \"ayodhya is irrelevant to the average muslim. but these leaders insist on projecting it as an issue central to the identity and existence of indian muslims.\" this exploitation of emotive issues worries many observers. \"the muslim political leadership tries to create symbols of identityâ€”like muslim personal law or the status of urduâ€”and then uses them to whip up sentiments,\" says s. zainuddin, a sociologist with aligarh muslim university. concurs mr alam, \"these symbols create the sense of a single â€˜indian muslimâ€™ identity and hide the immense diversity in the community.\" the kaleidoscopic nature of the indian muslim community was highlighted by numerous anthropological papers presented during the three-day-long seminar. so, for example, the dudekula muslims of andhra pradesh, whose women wear kumkum and who name their children after consulting their horoscopes, have little to do with the conventional stereotype of the indian muslim. likewise, the banjara muslims of deccan have virtually nothing in common with the matrilineal moplahs of kerala or the trader bohras of gujarat. \"in muslim gujarat alone, there are 130 categories listedâ€”from the sunni vohra to the khatri and mussalman,\" says journalist praful bidwai, who was one of the speakers at the seminar. \"itâ€™s important to emphasise this pluralism.\" cultural differences apart, fairly strict caste system holds swayâ€”ensuring that a sheikh or syed is unlikely to marry qureshi or bagban. \"when i started discussing these aspects, i was accused of being an agent of the bjp and trying to create dissension in the community. i was told that islam doesnâ€™t recognise castes and inequalities,\" says ali anwar, a journalist who has written extensively about the often pathetic plight of muslim obcs. adds mr ahmed, \"all fundamentalist movements thrive on the notion of a monolith. so, both the orthodox muslim leadership and the vhp want to project the community as a single unit.\" liberal muslims believe that the only way to counter the disease of fundamentalism is by injecting strong dose of vitamin dâ€”acknowledgment of diversity, democratisation and debateâ€”into the community. \"it is essential to create an alternate voice,\" says mr ahmed. \"after 1992, a few liberal movements did spring up. i, myself, go from town to town, district to district to conduct meetings in the community. sometimes i am greeted with anger. but at least tradition of debate is taking shape in the community. this is an important first step to a liberal, secular future.\"", "doc_labels": []}

''keka'' shastri, as he is better known, has seen it all since 1905 when he was born in mangrol in junagadh district. and he says the current animosity between hindus and muslims was primarily a post-partition phenomenon which started in ahmedabad and has now spread to the whole state. while he calls the godhra train attack as ''pre-planned'', he is also quick to point out that the backlash all over the state was ''spontaneous''. \"this (post-godhra riots) was tit for tat and this tidal wave of destruction was needed,\" he says. shastri says he feels for the first time hindus from all sections had outpoured their anger over what happened in godhra. \"the mobs consisted of people of cultured families for the first time, besides the poor and the lower classes who have experienced riots often in the past,\" he says. this, he said, was such a groundswell of anger and retribution that it just wasn''t possible for the government to control it. \"narendra nirdosh chhe\" (narendra is innocent), he says about the chief minister''s role in the riots. \"if there is anybody to blame for letting things out of control it is p c pande (the police commissioner) who showed slackness in this whole episode,\" says shastri. asked whether the police was slack because the bjp and its government was backing the ''bandh'' on february 28, he replied, \"the bandh was supposed to be a means of protest, but nobody planned or imagined violence on this scale, it was the duty of the police to control the mobs. did you expect narendra to go to pande''s residence and tell him to control the situation?\". shastri says in every riot in gujarat, it is the muslims who have provided the first spark, like it happened in godhra. \"in the 1985 riots, the hindus were at the receiving end for almost one month till they hit back,\" he recalls. this time it was like a ''tidal wave'' which swept everything aside in a matter of three days. \"the provocation in godhra was so grave that the retaliation was also very quick and deadly,\" he says. but he denies that vhp and bajrang dal were involved in the killings. \"maybe it is true in one or two places, but by and large this was the response of the hindu society, not the organisation,\" he claims. he is all praise for his ''disciple'', dr praveen togadia, a former vhp general secretary in gujarat under him, who has risen in his ranks. \"his sacrifice is supreme, he has given up his thriving practice as a surgeon and his clinic at bapunagar to serve the hindu society, he will certainly go very far because he is extremely intelligent and has an excellent memory,\" he says. after the supreme court order on wednesday, banning the march 15 puja, prof shastri says the vhp is \"awaiting orders from the saints\" on what to do next. he says he would like to see not only a ram temple in ayodhya during his lifetime but also a krishna temple at mathura and mahadev temple at kashi where mosques now exist. \"if sardar vallabhbhai patel had lived longer we wouldn''t have had to wait for so long,\" he said.

{"doc_id": 1040, "doc_text": "This story is from March 24, 2002\n\nmumbai: itâ€™s a tug-of-war between the powerful fishermen lobby and marine conservationists. the issue here is the ban on the hunting of sharks for their fins. the marine conservationists, led by organisations like mumbaibased reefwatch marine conservation (rwmc) and sanctuary magazine, are marshalling their resources to agitate against the modification of the july 2001 order which had put all sharks on schedule i of the wildlife act (which meant a blanket ban on their hunting), while the shark-fin export lobby is adamant that they will not stop hunting sharks, ban or no ban. at stake here is the survival of not only sharksâ€”the species that occupy the apex position in the marine ecosystemâ€”but even fragile marine life like groupers and coral reefs. responding to the intense agitation by marine scientists and conservationists, the union ministry of environment and forests brought a wide range of marine species including all types of sharks, corals, sea horses, sea fans, giant groupers and molluscs (shells) under the wildlife protection act in july last year. this was the first time that indiaâ€™s marine life had been placed under protection. the euphoria didnâ€™t last long. under pressure from the influential shark-fin export lobby, the government recently modified the ban, leaving out almost everything except nine species of sharks, citing socio-economic factors as a justification. says sarang kulkarni, marine biologist with rwmc, â€œthese are the commercial type of sharks. they are not as important in the preservation of the ecosystem as the oceanic and reef sharks that have been left out.â€™â€™ conservationists say that indiaâ€™s marine life is facing an sos-like situation. â€œindia, today, is the largest exporter of shark fins to the far east, which has depleted its resources and is now looking towards our shores. sharks are hunted for their fins, used to thicken soups in restaurants across the world and even eaten as a delicacy by indiaâ€™s rich and famous,â€™â€™ says mitali kakkar, director of rwmc. â€œsometimes, fishermen throw back live sharks into the sea after cutting off their fins, forcing them to die a painful death by drowning since sharks need fins to swim.â€™â€™ during recent coral reef survey projects conducted by reefwatch and united nations development project, no shark sightings have been recorded. considered the tiger of the ocean, sharks help maintain the marine ecosystem. any imbalance in their population affects fish stocks and ultimately the resources and livelihood of thousands of fishermen who are dependent on the marine wealth. kulkarni reveals that in malwan, on the konkan coast, he discovered even baby sharks finding their way into the nets of big trawlers.â€œwe have seen shark fins the size of a thumbnail being dried,â€™â€™ he says. â€œso you can imagine the size of the baby sharks that are coming into the nets off the coast of maharashtra and goa.all the money from shark hunting goes to the middlemen and not to the small fishermen.â€™â€™ arguing against the conservationists are the government and fishermen lobbies of coastal states like maharashtra, goa, kerala and gujarat, who say that the livelihood of several fishing families depends on shark hunting, which accounts for almost five per cent of indiaâ€™s total exports. â€œfish stocks like pomfrets, mackerel, sea salmons are down,â€™â€™ claims vijay bandarkar, president of the maharashtra macchimar kruti samiti. â€œwe have no choice but to catch whatever gets us returns. ultimately, you canâ€™t talk about ecological conservation when the livelihood of so many fishermen is at stake.â€™â€™ indeed, the issue at stake here is not only the survival of sharks but also the subsistence of a few lakh fishermen. pollution combined with fishing by foreign trawlers who, unlike traditional fishermen, catch fish even when they are spawning thus preventing juvenile fish from reaching maturity, has depleted stocks. conservationists admit that entire traditional coastal communities are on the brink of starvation and have no choice but to fish for products like shark fins which sell at about us $20,000 per ton in the international market. the solution probably lies in finding alternative means of livelihood for fishermen and restoring the ecological health of the seas. protecting predators at the apex is a part of this plan. â€œwe do not want to rob the fishing community of their income,â€™â€™ asserts kakkar, â€œthat is not the idea at all.â€™â€™ in malwan, for instance, reefwatch is conducting a survey to check if eco-tourism can be encouraged as an alternative. even in gujarat, where hunting for whale sharks is a major issue, the organisation has initiated a three-year project that suggests whale and shark watching expeditions as an eco-tourism activity, where fisher folk can use their boats to take tourists to watch whales. other long-term solutions could include cordoning off certain breeding grounds for a period of 3 to 5 years so that fish stocks are rejuvenated. â€œthese could be opened for fishing activities after

the economic downturn, the rapidly changing social fabric and the saffron brigadeâ€™s relentless preaching of its communal ideology have tinkered with the mindset of the average gujaratiâ€”a person believed to be more comfortable doing business than brandishing swords, with a reputation for being tolerant and accommodating, experts say. the militancy by gujaratis is the result of the constant cultivation of communal ideas through literature and the educational system, says delhi-based sociologist d l sheth. \"history textbooks and gujarati literature focus on the humiliation faced by hindus at the hands of muslims, especially the ravaging of the somnath temple by mohammed ghaznavi, not once but 15 times,\" he says. \"the repressed aggression among gujarati hindus against the minorities has found voice with the bjp government power.\" he says that the idea that gujaratis are peace-loving and tolerant was primarily formed by the dominance of the vegetarian jain and vaishnav communities in the state. \"but in the last 20 years, the composition cities has changed drastically with the steady arrival of migrants from other states,\" dr sheth says. \"the cities scarcely present gujarati culture or lifestyle any more.\" writer and former mumbai sh e r i f f chandrakant bakshi says the gujarati psyche was fated to be transformed. \"the pendulum of history moves from one extreme another. there is no middle ground. the most submissive race or community metamorphoses into the most aggressive one,\" he claims. \"this is evident from the change in the jewish mindset, pre- and post-holocaust.\" he believes that if a godhrastyle incident had occurred 50 years ago, gujarati hindus would been subdued. \"but the new post-independence generation... believes in quick retaliation, which is evident from the recent mayhem,\" he says. sociologist achyut yagnik marks the 1969 communal riots the turning point, as many secular gujaratis metamorphosed into religious chauvanists. \"civil society, literature and education the state systematically adopted a â€˜us vs themâ€™ discourse. the post-â€™69 generation of gujaratis has been raised on this communal doctrine,\" he says. \"this is responsible for the perceptible drop in tolerance levels against the minorities. it was evident during the 1992-â€™93 riots and the recent mayhem.\" the post-godhra riots, mr yagnik notes, are more disturbing because of the intensified level of violence and barbarism. this is something no gujarati can explain or analyse since we are still trying to come out from the shock and revulsion,\" he says. ghanshyam shah, a professor at delhiâ€™s jawaharlal nehru univeristy, says his study of several communal riots in gujarat revealed a pattern: \"the communal riots were started by a handful of strategists and fanned agents who were skilled in using weapons and ransacking shops and houses.\" he says that ordinary people were not involved previous riots and stayed passive â€”if somewhat insensitive observers. \"but what is disturbing this time is their witnessing and justifying the atrocities committed against the minorities,\" prof shah notes. \"for instance, the insistence that the minorities deserve what is happening to them.\" the decline of the congress and the gradual saffronisation the state, with its accompanying propagation of the hindutva ideology, has also been responsible for the change in the gujarati psyche, social scientists say. \"gujarat has always been communal to a certain extent, partially because it shares a border with pakistan. since 1985, the saffron brigade has tried to exploit this communal feeling â€”the state witnessed the biggest mass mobilisation for the ram janmabhoomi movement and l k advani started his ayodhya rath yatra from somnath 1990,\" says mr yagnik, coauthor creating national movement: ram janmabhoomi and fear of the self. he believes the bjp government has institutionalised communal indoctrination through the educational system and the media. \"exploiting the godhra incident was the perfect technique to consolidate the hindu vote-bank,\" mr yagnik says. concurs human rights activist teesta setalvad,\"itâ€™s a systematic and planned manipulation gujaratis by different agents, the vishwa hindu parishad, the rashtriya swayamseval sangh, the bharatiya janata part and the bajrang dal. they have tried hijack the gujarati culture and mindset and impose an extremely crude and macabre identity.\" gujarati herself, she says gujaratis should break their silence and call the bluff of the saffron bridage, which claims represent all hindus. economic frustration also contributed to the rage. mr shah says 80 per cent of participants in the 1973 riots in the state whom interviewed told him that they were either unemployed or underpaid. \"with a significant rise in the casualisation of the working class over the last 30 years, lumpen elements available for violence have also increased,\" he says. concurs mr sheth, \"the decline of the (textile) mills in the 1980s and the high rate of urban unemployment have pushed people to vent their frustration through violence. they are also prone to communal twists vested parties.\"", "doc_labels": []}

{"doc_id": 1104, "doc_text": "new delhi: the country's attorney-general pleading the vhp case in the supreme court made the bjp-led national democratic alliance look like a government of swayamsewaks. and the tv images of the pm's 'special envoy' accepting the carved pillars for the ram temple in ayodhya, gave the ceremony the official sanction the vishwa hindu parishad desired. indeed, ayodhya's return to centrestage over the last few weeks has presented the bjp's partners in the nda with their most serious ideological dilemma to date, given that all of them - barring the shiv sena - profess a commitment to secularism. on friday, it appeared as though the partners who had raised ''serious'' objections to the a-g's role, were willing to forgive the participation of a government representative in the shila daan ceremony. they all declared themselves satisfied since the court ruling banning any activity on the acquired land had been upheld, the administration had made enough arrests to prevent any concentration of karsewaks in ayodhya, and the day had passed off peacefully. but on saturday, after the vhp claimed that the acceptance of the shila by a government official indicated that its demand to start construction of the ram temple had been accepted, both the telugu desam party's yerran naidu and the tc's mamata bannerjee asked the pm on the floor of the lok sabha to clarify whether this claim was indeed true. clearly, the nda partners are torn: on the one hand, they are willing to overlook the bjp's lapses because the reasons that brought them together in 1998 hold true even now. in 1996, ideology kept them apart when the vajpayee government collapsed after 13 days; in 1998, they came together largely because of electoral compulsions, with the congress being the main rival for most of them in their own areas of influence. with the congress juggernaut marching steadily across the indian map, this is even more true today. on the other hand, it is becoming increasingly difficult for the allies to justify the position the bjp has been taking on the ayodhya issue to their own muslim constituency - they must, at least, appear to be keeping the bjp on its toes. so given this conflict between ideology and practical politics, what would be the breaking point for the bjp's allies? as samata party spokesperson shambhu srivastava put it, ''any violation of the supreme court order or failure to uphold the rule of law would have had serious implications and started off a chain reaction.'' or as yerran naidu phrased it,''if the bjp's intentions are followed by matching actions, then we would have had to review the situation.'' but though their patience has not run out, and the bjp has more to fear from the saffron brotherhood than from its allies, the recent assembly elections, combined with the events in ayodhya, have triggered off a qualitative difference in the relationship: the bjp's abysmal performance has made it look increasingly like a loser. as trinamul congress sources said, ''we would like to be back in the government, but the question is: are we boarding a sinking ship?'' and this concern has sparked off some behind-the-scenes activity: the recent ayodhya crisis saw the jd-u, the tc, the national conference, the dravida munnetra kazhagham and the indian national lok dal all getting in touch with andhra pradesh chief minister n chandrababu naidu; a meeting is likely after the assembly session concludes in hyderabad.\n\nFacebook Twitter Linkedin Mail", "doc_labels": ["ANY_ACTION", "ARREST"]}

vandana shiva, a leading environmentalist, admits that this is a very real danger, especially since gm crops are being brought into india at a time when the vast majority __ farmers, journalists, government, and scientists __ have not studied the implications of gm technology. ``india''s biosafety ignorance makes it gullible to corporate propaganda, and doesn''t allow us to act on our rights and responsibilities,'''' she says.\n\nironically, the farmers who have been badly hit by the chemical trap of pesticides are the ones most loudly clamouring for bt-cotton. they are joined by politicians, be it the chief minister of punjab or the agriculture minister of gujarat, economists, and members of the media in criticising the regulatory body, the geac in the ministry of environment and forests, for insisting on field trials to ascertain the suitability of bt-cotton in indian conditions.\n\nthese critics bemoan that india''s agricultural productivity and globalÂ� competitiveness are being held back. they point to china and how its bt-cotton is racing ahead in export markets without any apparent environmental or social costs.\n\nms shiva deflates the myth of china''s bt-cotton success by pointing out that the country is exporting more cotton because previously closed markets are liberalising, and not because of bt technology. ``commentators are confusing the consequences of trade with technology,'''' she says.\n\nmoreover, little biosafety or environmental data has emerged from china, adds ms sahai. according to her, the absence of data does not mean that there has been no environmental damage, but that there are no regulatory and monitoring processes in place. ``there are many environmental catastrophes in china, but the data might never be collected and will definitely not be allowed to leave the country easily,'''' she says. ``after all, china is not only the country of export successes but also of the cultural revolution and the great leap forward in which several millions of people were killed and the world didn''t know about this until decades later.''''\n\nexperts further assert that china is arguably the worst political template for india. ``political and technological questioning is not easily allowed there, especially if these go against policies of the party high command. expecting india to adhere to a similarly non-transparent dictatorial system is not only foolhardy, it is dangerous for our people,'''' asserts the bureaucrat from theÂ� ministry of environment and forests.\n\n``in no democratic country have gm crops been introduced in a hurry. only countries like china have hurriedly heralded them in,'''' affirms ms shiva. in this context, it is worth noting that the united states took about a decade before allowing large-scale gm cultivation. some countries in europe have outright banned gm crops. in other countries such as britain, where there isÂ� no commercial gm cultivation, gm food has been one of the most contentious topics of public debate in the last decade.\n\nas the debate in india on the pros and cons of gm crops builds up, few are calling for an outright ban on all gm crops and gm research. even critics of bt-cotton acknowledge that there are significant advantages to be reaped from this new technology __ be it in developing drought-resistant grains or higher yield pulses. ``it is more a question of whether we are going to be strong-armed into using gm crops in a hurry through a combination of aggressive multinational promotion and domestic gullibility and corruption, or whether we will adopt this technology selectively, under proper regulation, at our own pace, and on our own terms,'''' sums up ms sahai.", "doc_labels": []}

in assam and karnataka for the assembly elections. it persisted with finance minister yashwant sinha despite the fact that this man had failed to deliver on any front. the bjp has run out of steam and its future is bleak. the temple issue will not mobilise votes for it now. well, yes, the bjp has failed delhi. but the congress is not a remedy either. the record of its state government doesnâ€™t inspire much confidence. k.r. rai, janakpuri the bjpâ€™s reckless drive against illegal constructions in delhi and its handling of the communal carnage drove people away from it. it is now downhill for the bjp. it has been routed in four states, and its future at the centre looks bleak.delhiites are not fools to expect much from the congress. the party has a poor track record of development. vidyasagar, yojana vihar every action has a reaction. the poor record of the bjpâ€™s councillors was bound to hit its prospects in the polls. there was chaos as for as civic amenities were concerned. the state government, controlled by the congress, said something, and the mcd, controlled by the bjp, said something else. the two were working at cross-purposes. its finance minister yashwant sinha did not help matters by fleecing the middle class by imposing more burden on them.with the congress controlling both the state government and the mcd, let us hope there is a better coordination between the two. p.n. sachdev, anand vihar. the reasons for the bjpâ€™s rout in the mcd elections are obvious enough. its drive against illegal constructions, the anti-poor budget, the gujarat riots, the anti-incumbency factor, and the rumblings in the nda contributed to the partyâ€™s debacle in delhi. with the congress at the helm in the state and the mcd, more funds will ensure more development. it is up to the congress how it seizes this opportunity. o.p. bansal, janakpuri. by slicing off a huge chunk from the income of the middle class, the bjp antagonised its traditional vote bank. second, in connivance with the business community (which it represents), the party pursued an erratic policy on liberalisation and privatisation. people could see its game plan. third, it failed to rein in the rss, the vhp and the bajrang dal. and the party continues to persist with narender modi who is stoking the communal fire in his state. expect no better days for delhi because the congress is equally communal and power-hungry. ashok gupta, bali nagar. the bjpâ€™s anti-encroachment drive drove people away from it. the budget applied no balm on the bruised middle class either. anupam jain, rajinder nagar. the muddled budget and the communal riots did the bjp in. people see the bjp as incapable of governing. see how it is turning a blind eye to the shenanigans of the so-called sangh parivar. who are these people by the way? how many hindus do they represent? they are a bunch of self-serving middle-class people who donâ€™t have to bother about their bread and butter. they must be curbed and handed down stiff penalties. only then does the bjp has any future. the congress is the other side of the same coin. expect no respite, delhiites. manish kumar, gk-i.

{"doc_id": 1245, "doc_text": "new delhi: prime minister vajpayeeâ€™s gujarat visit next week may spell the beginning of the end of narendra modiâ€™s dispensation in the state, say well placed sources in the government. continued violence even after his delhi visit, his defiant demeanour and his shooting from the hip at the media, the opposition and even parliament, have made modiâ€™s position untenable, these sources point out. though unofficial, the announcement of vajpayeeâ€™s visit a week in advance has acquired a political significance. the message is that the pm has decided to ignore the pressures from the sangh parivar to retain modi. for starters, the centre may ask governor s s bhandari to send a report on the situation in gujarat to begin belatedly the constitutional process. that this has not been done for over a month, has not been noticed by political observers and constitutional experts familiar with past actions of the union government of the day. for the ruling bjp, which considers gujarat a testing ground for hindutva, the charge of a relation between the gujarat violence and the movement for the ram temple in ayodhya is embarrassing for its long-term plans. that the violence has spread to rural areas, is considered unprecedented and dangerous in official circles. sources in opposition and even in the ruling nda, point out the gross incongruity in the centreâ€™s constitutional behaviour. that the same party (bjp) dominates the government at the centre and runs the government in gujarat â€” coupled with a senior member of the sangh parivar holding the gubernatorial post â€” has permitted a measure of political sanguinity that has now become the talking point in political circles. for instance, it has been pointed out that even when the congress enjoyed power in centre and states â€” with senior partymen in raj bhavans â€” violence of a political nature, so widespread, ferocious and prolonged, was never permitted. according to durga das basuâ€™s treatise on the constitution, article 356 was utilised precisely a hundred times till 1997 and since then, another five times. defections, either local or organised from delhi, altered the numbers in legislatures to cause constitutional breakdowns in several cases. but in a majority of the cases, such breakdowns caused law and order situations that needed to be quelled by imposing presidentâ€™s rule. most recently, when violent disturbances occurred in manipur in protest against the extension of naga ceasefire, the vajpayee government quickly imposed presidentâ€™s rule. but in contrast, in gujarat, violent riots have been going on for over a month now and reports about the partisan role of the police and state government are legion but the centre doesnâ€™t seem unduly concerned.\n\nFacebook Twitter Linkedin Mail", "doc_labels": ["FAIL"]}
